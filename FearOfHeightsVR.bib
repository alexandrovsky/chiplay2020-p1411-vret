Transitioning from virtuality to reality for giving self-reports on VR experiences can potentially lead to systematic biases. VR allows for questionnaires to be embedded in the virtual environment, which may ease participation and avoid biases. To provide a cohesive picture of methods and design choices for questionnaires in VR (inVRQ), we identify and discuss 14 inVRQ studies from the literature and present a survey with 67 VR experts from academia and industry. Based on the outcomes, we conducted two user studies in which we first tested different presentation and interaction methods of inVRQs and then evaluated the usability and practicality of our design. Our results show comparable usability and performance between inVRQs and outVRQs with higher enjoyment ratings in VR. These findings advocate the application of inVRQs in VR user research and provide a diverse overview of methods and considerations that lays the groundwork for the design of inVRQs. This work can help researchers and developers with effectively employing questionnaires in VR.},

  abstract = {Objective:~Extensive research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress has not clarified whether that axis is activated by phobic anxiety. We addressed this issue by measuring cortisol in situational phobics during exposure treatment.
        Methods:~Salivary cortisol was measured in 11 driving phobics before and during three exposure sessions involving driving on crowded limited-access highways and compared with levels measured in 13 healthy controls before and during two sessions of driving on the same highways. For each subject, data collected in the same time period on a comparison nondriving day served as an individual baseline from which cortisol response scores were calculated.
        Results:~Cortisol levels of driving phobics and controls did not differ on the comparison day. Phobics also had normal cortisol response scores on awakening on the mornings of the exposures but these were already increased 1 hour before coming to the treatment sessions. Phobics had significantly greater cortisol response scores during driving exposure and during quiet sitting periods before and afterward. These greater responses generally paralleled increases in self-reported anxiety. At the first exposure session, effect sizes for differences in cortisol response scores between the two groups were large. Initial exposure to driving in the first session evoked the largest responses.
        Conclusion:~The data demonstrate that the HPA axis can be strongly activated by exposure to, and anticipation of, a phobic situation.},

Self-report measures were anticipated fear and dizziness before exposure, as well as actual fear and dizziness during the three situations. For all participants, fear, dizziness, and body sway were increased during exposure. Anticipated fear most reliably predicted body sway during exposure. In addition, persons scoring high on trait fear of heights anticipated and experienced more fear during exposure, but this relationship was not found for any objective measure. There was no evidence that vestibular function moderates the relationship between sub-clinical fear and body sway. The results underline the importance of cognitive factors, like anticipatory anxiety and overestimation of bodily symptoms, in fear of heights.},

              To examine barriers to initiation and continuation of mental health treatment among individuals with common mental disorders.
            
            
              Method
              
                Data were from the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. Representative household samples were interviewed face to face in 24 countries. Reasons to initiate and continue treatment were examined in a subsample (
                n
                ~=~636~78) and analyzed at different levels of clinical severity.
              
            
            
              Results
              Among those with a DSM-IV disorder in the past 12 months, low perceived need was the most common reason for not initiating treatment and more common among moderate and mild than severe cases. Women and younger people with disorders were more likely to recognize a need for treatment. A desire to handle the problem on one's own was the most common barrier among respondents with a disorder who perceived a need for treatment (63.8\%). Attitudinal barriers were much more important than structural barriers to both initiating and continuing treatment. However, attitudinal barriers dominated for mild-moderate cases and structural barriers for severe cases. Perceived ineffectiveness of treatment was the most commonly reported reason for treatment drop-out (39.3\%), followed by negative experiences with treatment providers (26.9\% of respondents with severe disorders).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Low perceived need and attitudinal barriers are the major barriers to seeking and staying in treatment among individuals with common mental disorders worldwide. Apart from targeting structural barriers, mainly in countries with poor resources, increasing population mental health literacy is an important endeavor worldwide.},

There is much of interest here to the student, researcher, and clinician in behavioral medicine, ergonomics, emotion, cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, and health psychology.Now in its fourth edition, Andreassi's Psychophysiology explores some of the newer areas of importance and updates findings in traditional topics of interest. Significant changes to this edition include: -- updated information on brain activity in memory, perception, and intelligence; -- new information on brain imaging and behavior; -- separate chapters on pupillography and eye movements; -- new information on the startle pattern and eyeblink; -- separate chapters on clinical and non-clinical applications; -- updated information on cardiovascular reactivity and personality; -- the latest biofeedback and ergonomics applications; -- novel findings in environmental psychophysiology; -- brief summaries at the end of each section; and-- an appendix on laboratory safetyEach chapter is a self-contained unit allowing instructors to customize the presentation the material. With over 1,700 citations, Andreassi's Psychophysiology is the definitive text in the field.An instructor's manual is now available. Based on the book, the manual is primari test bank to be used in giving examinations to students during the teaching of a course. Both multiple-choice and essay questions have been provided, along with lists of key terms and ideas. These can be used for definition-type questions and to highlight important concepts, as well as alerting the instructor to important terms and ideas that they may want to cover in lectures. Sample syllabi are provided for teaching a course at both undergraduate and graduate levels to help the instructor who is preparing a course for the first time. A number of possible laboratory exercises are also provided that can be carried out in conjunction with teaching the course.},

For  this  aim,  before  performing    the  top-rope  and lead  climbing,  the  anxiety  inventory  was  used  in  sport  rock  climbers.  Afterwards,  the  selected physiological parameters were recorded during the climbing.Four female and 22 male, totally 26 middle level rock climber were participated to the study. The mean age of the subjects was 27.73 {$\pm$}6.67, climbing years 6.61 {$\pm$}4.84 and lead climbing age was 5.71 {$\pm$}4.34.In  order  to  eliminate  force  loss  differences  between  top-rope  and  lead  climbing,  top  rope climbing was designed as if it is a lead climbing. The second rope was connected on the waist of the athletes during top-rope  climbing and  they clipped it to expresses  such  as leading.The  ascents  were perforformed on 15 m high climbing wall. The routewas rated as VI grad (Un\i on Internationale des Association d'Alpinisme).During  both  climbing    hearth  rate  was  recorded  and  energy  consumption  was  measured  by portable  gas  analyzer  as  MET  and  VO2ml.min.kg  units.  Though  gas  analyzer  VE,  RER  were measured.When  two  types  of  climbing  trial  compared,  results  indicated  that  there  were  statistically significant  mean  difference  between  CSAI-2  subscales  cognitive  anxiety,  somatic  anxiety  and  self confidence.  When  physiological  parameters  examined  in  terms  of  two  different  types  of  climbing, results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in HR values. However, there were significant differences found between VO2ml.min.kg, VE, RER, and MET values.There wasn't found significant difference inclimbing  times  between  two  trials.  This  result shows us that we designed the ascents successfully and could eliminate the physical differences both lead and top-rope climbing. We observed on the same work load of two climbing trials more oxygen consumption,  energy  expenditure  and  anxiety  scores  during  leading.  This  establishs  that  falling anxiety influences on physiologic parameters.},

Holographic displays, including head mounted units, support this vision by creating rich stereoscopic scenes, with objects that appear to float in thin air - often within arm's reach. However, one has but to reach out and grasp nothing but air to destroy the suspension of disbelief. Snake-charmer is an attempt to provide physical form to virtual objects by revisiting the concept of Robotic Graphics or Encountered-type Haptic interfaces with current commodity hardware. By means of a robotic arm, Snake-charmer brings physicality to a virtual scene and explores what it means to truly interact with an object. We go beyond texture and position simulation and explore what it means to have a physical presence inside a virtual scene. We demonstrate how to render surface characteristics beyond texture and position, including temperature; how to physically move objects; and how objects can physically interact with the user's hand. We analyze our implementation, present the performance characteristics, and provide guidance for the construction of future physical renderers.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to fill the partial theoretical vacuum surrounding the understanding of fear acquisition. A review of recent and contemporary theories of the etiology of fear is presented, serving as a justification for further theorizing and allowing for greater understanding of those aspects of fear that remain to be adequately explained. A new model of the etiology of specific fears is subsequently put forward and the various aspects and implications of this model are discussed. How an individual perceives a stimulus is proposed as being critical in determining fear in relation to the stimulus. In particular, perceptions of the stimulus as uncontrollable, unpredictable, dangerous and disgusting create a schema of vulnerability. The Cognitive Vulnerability Model integrates much of the extensive body of research on fears and specific phobias into a unifying theory of the etiology of fear. The model offers parsimonious explanations for the various characteristics of specific fears and phobias.},

In this paper we simulated stair climbing, and evaluated how well people could assess the distance they had climbed after several minutes of the activity under various conditions. We varied factors such as the presence of virtual feet (shoes), whether the stairwell was open or enclosed, the presence or absence of passive haptic markers, and whether a subject was ascending or descending. In general, the distance climbed or descended was overestimated, consistent with prior work on the perception of height. We find that subjects have significantly better ability to estimate their error with the presence of virtual shoes than without, and when the environment was open. Having shoes also resulted in significantly higher ratings of presence. We also find a significant tendency for females to show higher ratings of simulator sickness.},

The phonological and visuospatial subsystems have been extensively investigated, leading both to challenges over interpretation of individual phenomena and to more detailed attempts to model the processes underlying the subsystems. Analysis of the controlling central executive has proved more challenging, leading to a proposed clarification in which the executive is assumed to be a limited capacity attentional system, aided by a newly postulated fourth system, the episodic buffer. Current interest focuses most strongly on the link between working memory and long-term memory and on the processes allowing the integration of information from the component subsystems. The model has proved valuable in accounting for data from a wide range of participant groups under a rich array of task conditions. Working memory does still appear to be working.},

Results indicated that no EPT variables were consistently predictive of treatment outcome. No support was found for IFA or WSH; measures of BSH were predictive of short-term change, but these effects were attenuated at follow-up. Furthermore, EPT variables were not predictive of each other as previously hypothesized, indicating the variables are not functionally related.},

METHOD: Twenty-seven articles were identified on 25 video games that promoted health-related behavior change through December 2006.
RESULTS: Most of the articles demonstrated positive health-related changes from playing the video games. Variability in what was reported about the games and measures employed precluded systematically relating characteristics of the games to outcomes. Many of these games merged the immersive, attention-maintaining properties of stories and fantasy, the engaging properties of interactivity, and behavior-change technology (e.g., tailored messages, goal setting). Stories in video games allow for modeling, vicarious identifying experiences, and learning a story's "moral," among other change possibilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed on the optimal use of game-based stories, fantasy, interactivity, and behavior change technology in promoting health-related behavior change.},

We propose a method for improving performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation in high intensity VR exergaming. Our method is based on an interactive adaptation of the feedforward method: a psychophysical training technique achieving rapid improvement in performance by exposing participants to self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. We evaluated our method in a cycling-based exergame. Participants competed against (i) a self model which represented their previous speed; (ii) a self model representing their previous speed but increased resistance therefore requiring higher performance to keep up; or (iii) a virtual competitor at the same two levels of performance. We varied participants' awareness of these differences. Interactive feedforward led to improved performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation even when participants were aware of the interventions, and was superior to competing against a virtual competitor.},

Thirteen subjects navigated a virtual representation of Stonehenge and were asked to search for a rune, inscribed upon the wall of one of Stonehenge's edifices. After performing the search task, subjects completed a questionnaire designed to assess their level of presence within the virtual environment. The results indicated that the subjective report of presence within the virtual environment was significantly less using an update rate of 5 and 10 Hz when compared to update rates of 20 and 25 Hz. Furthermore, the reported level of presence using a 15 Hz update rate was similar to the reported level of presence using update rates of 20 and 25 Hz thus indicating that computational resources could be saved using a slower update rate while maintaining a given level of presence. In addition, a factor analysis procedure indicated that the 13 questions designed to assess the subjects sense of presence within virtual Stonehenge could be grouped into three factors: (1) virtual presence, (2) navigation within the virtual environment, and (3) knowledge of real world surroundings while in the virtual world. Finally, comments on a descriptive model of presence within virtual environments are presented.},

  abstract = {The present work from the superordinate study How do climbers experience and cope with stress and pressure situations while climbing, in their everyday life and in the psychological laboratory? A psychophysiological field and laboratory experiment had the goal to examine the effects of the factors of the falling height, the total height to the ground and the safety protocol on the three stress response dimensions of subjective feelings of stress (psychological), emotionally induced heart rate (psychophysiological) and hesitation and security behavior (motoric). 42 at least advanced level climbers climbed two times one short and easy warm up route and one hard and long main route (climbing phase). The order was randomized. At the end of each route they executed one deliberate jump into the rope. Depending on the safety protocol and the climbing phase this jump differed in its extent and in its distance to the ground. They filled in questionnaires continuously, wore ECG, movement and air pressure sensors and were filmed. The subjective feelings of stress were represented by various stress and anxiety scales, the psychophysiological measure by the construct of the Additional Heart Rate and hesitation and security behavior by expert video coding and time measures. In all the climbers didn't feel more than moderate stress, the Additional Heart Rate was about 20\% of the total heart rate and they didn't show more than moderate hesitation and security behavior. All factors had significant and mostly big to great effects on the three dimensions of stress responses. The falling height caused the greatest effects followed by the total height to the ground and the safety protocol. Climbing showed to be an efficient field for anxiety induction. Exploratory findings are presented, limitations and implications are discussed.},

During 4 hr of continuous mental tasks significantly higher cortisol levels were found in comparison with a control session. However, individual variability in the cortisol response was high. Correlational data indicate a significant negative relationship between the coping style `comforting cognitions' and the individual cortisol response during mental stress. During this particular type of cognitive stress, where the subject has no control over the experimental situation, comforting and emotion-focused coping may be effective because of the subject's efforts of trying to reframe the inevitable situation in a positive and self-encouraging way. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between trait anxiety and individual glucocorticoid susceptibility to mental stress.},

In this richly illustrated study, Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin offer a theory of mediation for our digital age that challenges this assumption. They argue that new visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film, and television. They call this process of refashioning "remediation," and they note that earlier media have also refashioned one another: photography remediated painting, film remediated stage production and photography, and television remediated film, vaudeville, and radio.},

        BORG, GUNNAR A.V. Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise, Vol. 14, No. 5, pp. 377\textendash 381, 1982. There is a great demand for perceptual effort ratings in order to better understand man at work. Such ratings are important complements to behavioral and physiological measurements of physical performance and work capacity. This is true for both theoretical analysis and application in medicine, human factors, and sports. Perceptual estimates, obtained by psychophysical ratio-scaling methods, are valid when describing general perceptual variation, but category methods are more useful in several applied situations when differences between individuals are described. A presentation is made of ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the Borg Scale for ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category method with ratio properties. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are discussed in both theoretical-psychophysical and psychophysiological frames of reference.

Communication and information technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have improved exposure treatment adherence and acceptance. Serious games (SG) could also be used in order to facilitate exposure treatment. A line of research on SG is emerging which focuses on health issues. We have developed a SG for the treatment of cockroach phobia that uses a mobile phone as the application device. This work examines results of an N=1 study about whether the use of this mobile game can facilitate treatment of this specific phobia preparing her for the AR exposure. A 25-year-old woman with cockroach phobia participated in the study. Results showed that the use of the mobile game reduced her level of fear and avoidance before a ``one-session'' AR exposure treatment was applied, following the guidelines by \"Ost. The participant found very helpful the use of the SG before the AR exposure session and she was willing to use it after the AR exposure session as a homework assignment. Although the results of this study are preliminary, SG appears to be a line of research of high interest in clinical psychology for the treatment of specific phobias.},

Evidence reveals that virtual reality (VR) is an effective treatment for phobias and useful for studying specific issues, such as pharmacological compounds and behavioral manipulations, that can enhance treatment outcomes. In addition, some variables, such as sense of presence in virtual environments, have a significant influence on outcomes, but further research is needed to better understand their role in therapeutic outcomes. We conclude that VR is a useful tool to improve exposure therapy and it can be a good option to analyze the processes and mechanisms involved in exposure therapy and the ways this strategy can be enhanced. In the coming years, there will be a significant expansion of VR in routine practice in clinical contexts.},

It will be an indispensable reference for the practitioner, researcher, and student interested in 3D user interfaces.''   \textemdash Andy van Dam ``Finally, the book we need to bridge the dream of 3D graphics with the user-centered reality of interface design. A thoughtful and practical guide for researchers and product developers. Thorough review, great examples.''   \textemdash Ben Shneiderman As 3D technology becomes available for a wide range of applications, its successful deployment will require well-designed user interfaces (UIs). Specifically, software and hardware developers will need to understand the interaction principles and techniques peculiar to a 3D environment. This understanding, of course, builds on usability experience with 2D UIs. But it also involves new and unique challenges and opportunities. Discussing all relevant aspects of interaction, enhanced by instructive examples and guidelines,  3D User Interfaces  comprises a single source for the latest theory and practice of 3D UIs. Many people already have seen 3D UIs in computer-aided design, radiation therapy, surgical simulation, data visualization, and virtual-reality entertainment. The next generation of computer games, mobile devices, and desktop applications also will feature 3D interaction. The authors of this book, each at the forefront of research and development in the young and dynamic field of 3D UIs, show how to produce usable 3D applications that deliver on their enormous promise. Coverage includes:  The psychology and human factors of various 3D interaction tasks Different approaches for evaluating 3D UIs Results from empirical studies of 3D interaction techniques Principles for choosing appropriate input and output devices for 3D systems Details and tips on implementing common 3D interaction techniques Guidelines for selecting the most effective interaction techniques for common 3D tasks Case studies of 3D UIs in real-world applications  To help you keep pace with this fast-evolving field, the book's Web site, www.3dui.org, will offer information and links to the latest 3D UI research and applications.},

Phobias are determined from information from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), classified according to DSM III. Phobias are found to be the most common psychiatric disorder in the community, more common than major depression or alcohol abuse or dependence in the month prior to interview. The one month prevalence is between 4.0 and 11.1\%, with the estimated prevalence in the United States being 6.2\%. There were nine community surveys of the prevalence of phobia that pre-dated the ECA studies, which found a wide range of prevalence rates from 1.2\% to 26.1\%. By far the strongest risk factor associated with phobias is the presence of another psychiatric disorder. Prevalence rates of simple phobia and agoraphobia are found in the ECA studies to be significantly higher in women; social phobia, which is less prevalent, has no significant sex difference. The prevalence rates are higher in younger age groups, and in those with low socioeconomic status (SES). The onset of phobias occurs primarily in the childhood or teenage years, and they tend to be chronic conditions. Less than a quarter of phobics receive treatment.},

Several tests of psychological state were given. Expert parachutists scored significantly higher than novices on Psychoticism and Experience seeking. Thrill and Adventure seeking correlated negatively and Trait anxiety positively with several measures of state anxiety. The only trait variable that correlated with heart rate was Psychoticism which had a negative correlation with two measures of increase in heart rate before making the jump. Number of jumps was the only good predictor of heart rate in expert jumpers at exit from the plane. Eysenck's arousal theory was not corroborated. Extraversion was unrelated to psychological state and heart rate. An exception was that among expert jumpers heart rate at exit from plane correlated negatively with extraversion.},

  abstract = {Organizations are facing an engagement crisis. Regardless if they are customers, employees, patients, students, citizens, stakeholders, organizations struggle to meaningfully engage their key constituent groups who have a precious and limited resource: their time. Not surprisingly, these stakeholders have developed deflector shields to protect themselves. Only a privileged few organizations are allowed to penetrate the shield, and even less will meaningfully engage. To penetrate the shield, and engage the audience, organizations need an edge. Gamification has emerged as a way to gain that edge and organizations are beginning to see it as a key tool in their digital engagement strategy. While gamification has tremendous potential to break through, most companies will get it wrong. Gartner predicts that by 2014, 80\% of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives primarily due to poor design. As a trend, gamification is at the peak of the hype cycle; it has been oversold and it is broadly misunderstood. We are heading for the inevitable fall. Too many organizations have been led to believe that gamification is a magic elixir for indoctrinating the masses and manipulating them to do their bidding. These organizations are mistaking people for puppets, and these transparently cynical efforts are doomed to fail. This book goes beyond the hype and focuses on the 20\% that are getting it right. We have spoken to hundreds of leaders in organizations around the world about their gamification strategies and we have seen some spectacular successes. The book examines some of these successes and identifies the common characteristics of these initiatives to define the solution space for success. It is a guide written for leaders of gamification initiatives to help them avoid the pitfalls and employ the best practices, to ensure they join the 20\% that gets it right. Gamify shows gamification in action: as a powerful approach to engaging and motivating people to achieving their goals, while at the same time achieving organizational objectives. It can be used to motivate people to change behaviors, develop skills, and drive innovation. The sweet spot for gamification objectives is the space where the business objectives and player objectives are aligned. Like two sides of the same coin, player and business goals may outwardly appear different, but they are often the same thing, expressed different ways. The key to gamification success is to engage people on an emotional level and motivating them to achieve their goals.},

In this paper we focus on rock climbing and we examine existing work on climbing from varying fields, including sports science, psychology, and climbing literary works, in order to identify recurring motivational themes. In total we identify and describe five key themes from these works: ``risk as a measure of progress'', ``maintaining challenge'', ``social engagement'', ``experiencing beauty and nature'', and ``documenting and reliving the experience''. We then examine how existing digital climbing experiences address these themes and suggest ways in which these interactive climbing designs could embrace the themes they do not yet address. We believe this work will be important not only when designing digital climbing experiences, but also digital experiences for other extreme sports.},

  abstract = {According to Roger Caillois, play is "an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy, ingenuity, skill, and often of money." In spite of this - or because of it - play constitutes an essential element of human social and spiritual development.In this classic study, Caillois defines play as a free and voluntary activity that occurs in a pure space, isolated and protected from the rest of life. Play is uncertain, since the outcome may not be foreseen, and it is governed by rules that provide a level playing field for all participants. In its most basic form, play consists of finding a response to the opponent's action - or to the play situation - that is free within the limits set by the rules.Caillois qualifies types of games - according to whether competition, chance, simulation, or vertigo (being physically out of control) is dominant - and ways of playing, ranging from the unrestricted improvisation characteristic of children's play to the disciplined pursuit of solutions to gratuitously difficult puzzles. Caillois also examines the means by which games become part of daily life and ultimately contribute to various cultures their most characteristic customs and institutions. Presented here in Meyer Barash's superb English translation, Man, Play and Games is a companion volume to Caillois's Man and the Sacred.},

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},

Their task was to indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information subjects received about rotation and translation was that provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects physically turned in place to steer while translating in the virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment was the absolute error of the subject's directional estimate to each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore virtual environments using real rotations and translations in tasks involving spatial orientation.},

  abstract = {Background
              Internet interventions for improving health and well-being have the potential to reach many people and fill gaps in service provision. Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games.
            
            
              Objective
              To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective.
            
            
              Methods
              We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework.
            
            
              Results
              A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), autonomy, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study's method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user's sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose.},

We present haptic turk, a different approach to motion platforms that is light and mobile. The key idea is to replace motors and mechanical components with humans. All haptic turk setups consist of a player who is supported by one or more turkers. The player enjoys an interactive experience, such as a flight simulation. The motion in the player's experience is generated by the turkers who manually lift, tilt, and push the player's limbs or torso. To get the timing and force right, timed motion instructions in a format familiar from rhythm games are displayed on turkers' mobile devices, which they attach to the player's body. We demonstrate a range of installations based on mobile phones, projectors, and head-mounted displays. In our user study, participants rated not only the experience as player as enjoyable (6.1/7), but also the experience as a turker (4.4/7). The approach of leveraging humans allows us to deploy our approach anytime anywhere, as we demonstrate by experimentally deploying at an art festival in the Nevada desert.},

  abstract = {TurkDeck is an immersive virtual reality system that reproduces not only what users see and hear, but also what users feel. TurkDeck produces the haptic sensation using props, i.e., when users touch or manipulate an object in the virtual world, they simultaneously also touch or manipulate a corresponding object in the physical world. Unlike previous work on prop-based virtual reality, however, TurkDeck allows creating arbitrarily large virtual worlds in finite space and using a finite set of physical props. The key idea behind TurkDeck is that it creates these physical representations on the fly by making a group of human workers present and operate the props only when and where the user can actually reach them. TurkDeck manages these so-called "human actuators" by displaying visual instructions that tell the human actuators when and where to place props and how to actuate them. We demonstrate TurkDeck at the example of an immersive 300m2 experience in 25m2 physical space. We show how to simulate a wide range of physical objects and effects, including walls, doors, ledges, steps, beams, switches, stompers, portals, zip lines, and wind. In a user study, participants rated the realism/immersion of TurkDeck higher than a traditional prop-less baseline condition (4.9 vs. 3.6 on 7 item Likert).},

Novice parachute jumpers presented a higher psychophysiological stress response than the experienced jumpers, together with a large anticipatory anxiety response before the jump; however, this decreased after the jump, although the high physiological activation was maintained.

Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used in the psychological treatment of acrophobia since 1995, and has come to dominate the treatment of numerous anxiety disorders. It is now known that virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) regimens are highly effective for acrophobia treatment. This paper reviews current theoretical understanding of acrophobia as well as the evolution of its common treatments from the traditional exposure therapies to the most recent virtually guided ones. In particular, the review focuses on recent innovations in the use of VR technology and discusses the benefits it may offer for examining the underlying causes of the disorder, allowing for the systematic assessment of interrelated factors such as the visual, vestibular and postural control systems.},

College students (N=356) enrolled in physical activity classes completed multidimensional measures of FF and achievement goals on four occasions in a 3-week interval. FF was positively related to mastery-avoidance (MAv), performance-approach (PAp), and performance-avoidance (PAv) achievement goals. FF scores predicted residualized change in MAv and PAv (but not MAp or PAp) goal scores across occasions. Goal scores did not reliably predict residualized change in FF scores across occasions. Results were consistent with the hierarchical model of achievement motivation and suggest that FF may indeed have a causal influence on achievement goals.},

The question raised is the nature of the process by which an environment-sensorimotricity coupling is organized.

The entropy of the climber's trajectory is used to measure the degree of structuring in the successive states of the subject-environment system during the learning of a complex task. It will be shown that the entropy of the trajectory decreases as learning progresses, and that the shape of the entropy curve is a function of the climber's level of expertise. A model of constraint relaxation is proposed to describe the learning process. Then, based on a theory of probabilistic inference, an attemp is made to show that this natural biological process obeys the thermodynamic laws of neural networks.},

  abstract = {Our work is aimed at studying the optimization of a complex motor behaviour from a global perspective. First, `free climbing' as a sport will be briefly introduced while emphasizing in particular its psychomotor aspect called `route finding'. The basic question raised here is how does the optimization of a sensorimotoricity-environment system take place. The material under study is the free climber's trajectory, viewed as the `signature' of climbing behaviour (i.e., the spatial dimension). The concepts of learning, optimization, constraint, and degrees of freedom of a system will be discussed using the synergistic approach to the study of movement (Bernstein, 1967; Kelso, 1977). Measures of a trajectory's length and convex hull can be used to define an index whose equation resembles that of an entropy. This index is a measure of the trajectory's overall complexity. Some important concepts related to the thermodynamics of curves will also be discussed. The optimization process will be studied by examining the changes in entropy over time for a set of trajectories generated during the learning of a route (ten successive repetitions of the same climb). It will be shown that the entropy of the trajectories decreases as learning progresses, that each level of expertise has its own characteristic entropy curve, and that for the subjects tested, the mean entropy of skilled climbers is lower than that of average climbers. Basing our analysis on the concepts of degrees of freedom and constraint equations, an attempt is made to relate trajectory entropy to system entropy. Based on the postulate that trajectory entropy is equal to the difference in entropy between the unconstrained and constrained system, a model of motor optimization is proposed. This model is illustrated by an entropy graph reflecting a dynamic release process. In the light of our results, two opposing views will be examined: movement construction vs. movement emergence.},

The results of the initial CFA on the calibration sample resulted in a poor fit to the data. Using the Lagrange Multiplier Test (Gamma) as a guide, CSAI-2 items that loaded on more than one factor were sequentially deleted. The resulting 17-item revised CSAI-2 was then subjected to a CFA using the validation data sample. The results of this CFA revealed a good fit of the data to the model (CFI = .95, NNFI = .94, RMSEA = .054).

Method: The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS). Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon \& Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

The crucial component of locomotor experience in this emotional change is developments in visual proprioception \textendash{} the optically-based perception of self-movement. Pre-crawling infants randomly assigned to drive a powered-mobility-device (PMD), showed significantly greater visual proprioception, and significantly greater wariness of heights, than controls. More importantly, visual proprioception scores mediated the relation between wariness of heights and locomotor experience. In a separate study, visual proprioception predicted whether crawling infants would descend onto the deep side of a visual cliff, confirming the importance of visual proprioception in the development of wariness of heights.},

It utilizes multi-wavelength technology and optimized sensor geometry to monitor blood flow at different depths of skin tissue, and it dynamically adapts to an optimal measurement depth in different conditions. Movement artefacts are reduced by adaptive movement-cancellation algorithms and optimized mechanics, which stabilize the sensor-to-skin contact. In this paper, we evaluated the accuracy and reliability of PulseOn technology against ECG-derived HR in laboratory conditions during a wide range of physical activities and also during outdoor sports. In addition, we compared the performance to another on-the-shelf wrist-worn consumer product Mio LINK\textregistered. The results showed PulseOn reliability (\% of time with error {$<$};10bpm) of 94.5\% with accuracy (100\% - mean absolute percentage error) 96.6\% as compared to ECG (vs 86.6\% and 94.4\% for Mio LINK\textregistered, correspondingly) during laboratory protocol. Similar or better reliability and accuracy was seen during normal outdoor sports activities. The results show that PulseOn provides reliability and accuracy similar to traditional chest strap ECG HR monitors during cardiovascular exercise.},

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

To investigate arousal during VR exposure, we exposed 40 patients with acrophobia and 40 matched healthy controls to a VR height challenge and assessed subjective (fear ratings) and physiological (heart rate, skin conductance level, salivary cortisol) fear reactions.

Patients experienced a significant increase of subjective fear, heart rate and skin conductance level. Unexpectedly, controls, who reported no subjective fear, also showed an increase in heart rate and skin conductance. There was no increase in salivary cortisol levels in either group.

Physiological arousal in acrophobic patients, in contrast to subjective fear, might not be stronger than that of controls confronted with height cues in VR, indicating marked discordance across symptom domains. The lack of a cortisol response in a clearly stressful paradigm warrants further study.},

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction" -- an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality -- reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

However, confusion exists within the literature about the precise definition of telepresence. Furthermore, there is a need for a plausible and parsimonious model of telepresence. This paper identifies three types of telepresence extant in the literature: simple telepresence, cybernetic telepresence, and experiential telepresence. The third definition is the most interesting. This paper reviews the origins of experiential telepresence and the theoretical approaches commonly used to explain it. One can term these technological approaches, which emphasize the role of control/display technology, and psychological approaches, which identify experiential telepresence with known psychological phenomena. Finally, the paper presents and discusses an integrative approach to telepresence featuring a structured attentional resource model. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of future human-machine interfaces for teleoperated robots and virtual reality systems.},

  abstract = {Rock climbing is a multi-discipline activity that encompasses forms such as bouldering, top roping and lead climbing on natural and artificial climbing surfaces. A major focus of research has been explanation of physiological functioning. More recent research indicates that anxiety levels are elevated for less experienced climbers and in response to lead climbing ascents. Research regarding the demands of rock climbing has placed a lesser focus on the interaction of psychological and physiological factors. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an on-sight lead climb on the physiological and psychological demands of the climb in comparison with a subsequent lead climb. Ten intermediate level climbers volunteered to complete the two climbing trials, on-sight lead climb (OSLC) and second lead climb (LC2). Climb time, lactate concentrations (baseline, pre climb, post climb and 15 min post climb), heart rate (1 min pre climb, peak HR, 1 min post climb and average climb across the duration of the climb), oxygen consumption, pre climb anxiety (CSAI-2R) were assessed for each climber for both trials. Results indicated that there were significant differences in self reported pre climb somatic and cognitive anxiety (t((9)) = 2.79, p = 0.01, t((9)) = 1.94, p = 0.043), climb time (t((9)) = 3.07, p = 0.0052) and post climb lactate concentrations between the climbs (t((9)) = 2.58, p = 0.015). These results indicate that psychological as well as physiological stress impact upon the response to rock climbing. The higher anxiety levels associated with an OSLC are likely to have influenced the physiological responses for the intermediate climbers in this study. Future studies should take into account the type of climbing, experience of climbers and the number of ascents as well as taking into account the interaction between physiological and psychological factors in response to rock climbing.},

More recently, differences in the physiological responses for an on-sight lead climb and subsequent lead climb have been reported. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of style of climb (lead climb or top rope climb) on the physiological and psychological responses to rock climbing. Nine intermediate climbers volunteered for, and completed, two randomly assigned climbing trials and a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a separate occasion. The climbers ascended the same 6a (sport grade) climb for both trials. Before climbing, heart rate, perception of anxiety (Revised Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2), and blood lactate concentration were measured. Climb time, heart rate, VO2, lactate concentrations, and task load (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index) in response to each trial were also recorded. Results indicated significant differences (P{$<$}0.05) between the trials for climb time, blood lactate concentration immediately after and 15 min after climbing, and heart rate 1 min after climbing. During lead and top rope climbing, mean VO2 and represented 44\% and 42\% of treadmill VO2max and mean heart rate represented 81\% and 77\% of maximum heart rate, respectively. There were no significant differences in feelings of anxiety before either climb, although climbers reported the lead climb to be physically and mentally more demanding, requiring more effort and resulting in greater frustration (P{$<$}0.05) than the top rope climb. Our results indicate that the physiological and psychological responses of intermediate climbers are different for a lead climb and top rope climb.},

This research, however, was conducted in a situation where the climbers had previously climbed the route. The purpose of our study was to examine this relationship in response to on-sight climbing. Nineteen (13 male, 6 female) intermediate climbers volunteered to attend anthropometric and baseline testing sessions, prior to an on-sight ascent (lead climb or top-rope) of the test climb (grade 19 Ewbank/6a sport/5.10b YDS). Data recorded included state anxiety, self-confidence and cortisol concentrations prior to completing the climb. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in state anxiety, self-confidence and plasma cortisol concentration regardless of the style of ascent (lead climb or top-rope) in an on-sight sport climbing context. Regression analysis indicated there was a significant linear relationship between plasma cortisol concentrations and self-confidence (r= - 0.52, R\textsuperscript{2}=0.267, p=0.024), cognitive (r=0.5, R\textsuperscript{2}=0.253, p=0.028), and somatic anxieties (r=0.46, R\textsuperscript{2}=0.210, p=0.049).

  abstract = {Convergent experimental data, autobiographical studies, and investigations on daily life have all demonstrated that gathering information retrospectively is a highly dubious methodology. Retrospection is subject to multiple systematic distortions (i.e., 
affective valence effect, mood congruent memory effect, duration neglect; peak end rule) as it is based on (often biased) storage and recollection of memories of the original experience or the behavior that are of interest. The method of choice to circumvent these biases is the use of electronic diaries to collect self-reported symptoms, behaviors, or physiological processes in real time. Different terms have been used for this kind of methodology: ambulatory assessment, ecological momentary assessment, experience sampling method, and real-time data capture. Even though the terms differ, they have in common the use of computer-assisted methodology to assess self-reported symptoms, behaviors, or physiological processes, while the participant undergoes normal daily activities. In this review we discuss the main features and advantages of ambulatory assessment regarding clinical psychology and psychiatry: (a) the use of realtime assessment to circumvent biased recollection, (b) assessment in real life to enhance generalizability, (c) repeated assessment to investigate within person processes, (d) multimodal assessment, including psychological, physiological and behavioral data, (e) the opportunity to assess and investigate context-specific relationships, and (f) the possibility of giving feedback in real time. Using prototypic examples from the literature of clinical psychology and psychiatry, we demonstrate that ambulatory assessment can answer specific research questions better than laboratory or questionnaire studies.

The virtual environments used in treatment were exactly copied from the real environments used in the exposure in vivo program. VR exposure was found to be as effective as exposure in vivo on anxiety and avoidance as measured with the Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ), the Attitude Towards Heights Questionnaire (ATHQ) and the Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT). Results were maintained up to six months follow-up.

The present study shows that VR exposure can be effective with relatively cheap hardware and software on stand-alone computers currently on the market. Further studies into the effectiveness of VR exposure are recommended in other clinical groups as agoraphobics and social phobics and studies in which VR exposure is compared with more emerging virtual worlds as presented in CAVE-type systems.},

  abstract = {Regular physical activity can be an efficient method for prevention for anxiety. The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 8 weeks of sport rock climbing (SRC) training on anxiety in healthy sedentary adults. A total number of nineteen students participated in this study voluntarily composing of a control group (CG, n=10, age 21.90 {$\pm$} 1.66 years, height 168.50 {$\pm$} 4.40 cm, weight 61.18 {$\pm$} 7.08 kg) and an experimental group (EG, n=9, age 21.11 {$\pm$} 2.31 years, height 167.33 {$\pm$} 6.44 cm, weight 59.31 {$\pm$} 8.39 kg). After the EG had been taught basic climbing and rope techniques, body composition and aerobic power measurements were taken for both groups. The EG engaged in climbing training by using a top-rope method for 60 minutes a day with an intensity level of 70 \% of HR reserve, three days a week for eight weeks. The CG did not engage in any systematic physical activity program during the study. The Competitive Sport Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) was given to participants twice. The EG completed the Inventory 20 minutes before the first and the last climbing trial. The CG completed the Inventories on first and last day of 8 weeks period. The results indicated significant changes in all CSAI-2 results for EG, including cognitive (p\_=\_0.002) and somatic anxiety (p\_=\_0.032) reduced, self-confidence (p\_=\_0.001) increased. This current study is one of the first research efforts examining the psychological effects of eight weeks SRC training. Results demonstrated that eight weeks of SRC training significantly reduces cognitive and somatic anxiety and increases self-confidence. In addition to the psychological effects, eight weeks of SRC training also improved the VO2max of participants. This study suggests that SRC can be useful as a regular physical activity in controlling and improving anxiety in the study sample.},

Theories of anxiety and performance need to address at least two major issues: (1) the complexity and apparent inconsistency of the findings; and (2) the conceptual definition of task difficulty. Some theorists (e.g. Humphreys \& Revelle, 1984; Sarason, 1988) argue that anxiety causes worry, and worry always impairs performance on tasks with high attentional or short-term memory demands. According to the processing efficiency theory, worry has two main effects: (1) a reduction in the storage and processing capacity of the working memory system available for a concurrent task; and (2) an increment in on-task effort and activities designed to improve performance. There is a crucial distinction within the theory between performance effectiveness (= quality of performance) and processing efficiency (= performance effectiveness divided by effort). Anxiety characteristically impairs efficiency more than effectiveness.},

Results showed Corsi performance depended mainly on the central executive and visuospatial sketchpad components of working memory. Adverse effects of trait anxiety on the Corsi task were observed on the central executive but not on the phonological loop or the visuospatial sketchpad. These effects were not mediated by state anxiety. The findings indicate for the first time that trait anxiety impairs central executive functioning on a nonverbal task, and that anxiety does not impair functioning of the ``slave'' systems (i.e., phonological loop; visuospatial sketchpad). Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Ambulatory Assessment refers to the use of computer-assisted methodology for self-reports, behavior records or physiological measurements, while the participant undergoes normal daily activities. For this, since the nineteen-eighties portable microcomputer systems and physiological recorders/analyzers have been developed. In contrast to their use in medicine, up until today the new methods have hardly entered the domain of psychology. Questionnaire methods are still preferred, in spite of the known deficiencies of retrospective self-reports. Assessment strategies include: continuous monitoring, monitoring with time and event sampling methods, in-field psychological testing, field experimentation, interactive assessment, symptom monitoring, and self-management. These approaches are innovative and address ecological validity, context specificity, and are suitable for practical applications. The advantages of this methodology, as well as issues of acceptance, compliance, and reactivity are discussed. Many technical developments and research contributions came from the German-speaking countries and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, but also the current Decade of Behavior (APA) calls for a more wide-spread use of such techniques and developments in assessment. This position paper seeks to make the case for this approach by demonstrating the advantages-and in some domains-necessities of ambulatory monitoring methodology for a behavioral science orientation in psychology.

It was concluded that with repeated exposure to threat, expanding gradients of activa-tion and of inhibition develop, the latter with steeper slope. The early rise in activation provides an automatic signal of danger, while the inhibitory reaction prevents the arousal from becoming excessive, thus providing a highly adaptive mechanism for the mastery of threat. AHE PRESENT REPORT concerns one of a series of studies on the measurement of conflict and stress associated with sport parachuting.

Practically all augmented reality systems rely on standard real-time rendering methods for displaying graphical objects. Although such conventional computer graphics algorithms are fast, they often fail to produce sufficiently realistic renderings. Therefore, virtual models can easily be distinguished from the real environment. We have recently proposed a novel approach for generating augmented reality images [4]. Our method is based on the idea of applying stylization techniques for adapting the visual realism of both the camera image and the virtual graphical objects. Since both the camera image and the virtual objects are stylized in a corresponding way, they appear very similar. Here, we present a new method for the stylization of augmented reality images. This approach generates a painterly brush stroke rendering. The resulting stylized augmented reality video frames look similar to paintings created in the pointillism style. We describe the implementation of the camera image filter and the non-photorealistic rendererfor virtual objects. These components have been newly designed or adapted for this purpose. They are fast enough for generating augmented reality images in near real-time (more than 14 frames per second).},

  abstract = {Computer games are ubiquitous and can be utilised for serious purposes such as health and education. `Applied games' including serious games (in brief, computerised games for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three processes. Firstly, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Secondly, by improving engagement through both game-based and `serious' motivational dynamics. Thirdly, by utilising varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, CBT based serious games and gamification, entertainment games, biofeedback and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Serious games and gamification have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centred approaches are needed to respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The ability to monitor training is critical to the process of quantitating training periodization plans. To date, no method has proven successful in monitoring training during multiple types of exercise. High-intensity exercise training is particularly difficult to quantitate. In this study we evaluate the ability of the session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method to quantitate training during non-steady state and prolonged exercise compared with an objective standard based on heart rate (HR). In a 2-part design, subjects performed steady state and interval cycle exercise or practiced basketball. Exercise bouts were quantitated using both the session RPE method and an objective HR method. During cycle exercise, the relationship between the exercise score derived using the session RPE method and the HR method was highly consistent, although the absolute score was significantly greater with the session RPE method. During basketball, there was a consistent relationship between the 2 methods of monitoring exercise, although the absolute score was also significantly greater with the session RPE method. Despite using different subjects in the 2 parts of the study, the regression relationships between the session RPE method and the HR method were nearly overlapping, suggesting the broad applicability of this method. We conclude that the session RPE method is a valid method of quantitating exercise training during a wide variety of types of exercise. As such, this technique may hold promise as a mode and intensity-independent method of quantitating exercise training and may provide a tool to allow the quantitative evaluation of training periodization plans.},

This observation may not be true for advanced climbers, who train regularly on lead routes and are accustomed to leader falls. The aim of this study was to compare the psychophysiological stresses of lead and top rope on-sight ascents in advanced rock climbers. Twenty-one climbers (18 men and three women) ascended routes near or at the best of their ability (22 Ewbank). Psychological stress was measured preclimb using the Revised Comparative State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI-2R). Plasma cortisol was sampled at six intervals. The volume of oxygen (VO2) and heart rate (Hr) were measured throughout the climbs. No significant differences were found in self-confidence, somatic, or cognitive anxiety between the conditions lead and top rope. No significant differences in plasma cortisol concentration were found between any time points. No significant relationships were found between cortisol and any CSAI-2R measures. No significant differences were found between conditions for VO2 or blood lactate concentration. During the lead climb, Hr was significantly elevated during the last part of the route. Findings suggest that advanced rock climbers do not find lead climbing to be more stressful than top rope climbing during an on-sight ascent.},

[18], the experimental goals were to explore whether VR presence instruments were useful in AR (and to modify them where appropriate), to compare additional measures to these well-researched techniques, and to determine if findings from VR evaluations can be transferred to AR. An experimental protocol appropriate for AR was developed. The initial experimental findings concern varying immersion factors (frame rate) and their effect on feelings of presence, user performance and behavior. Unlike the VR study, which found differing frame rates to affect presence measures, there were few differences in the five frame rate modes in our study as measured by the qualitative and quantitative instruments, which included physiological responses, a custom presence questionnaire, task performance, and user behavior. The AR presence questionnaire indicated users experienced a high feeling of presence in all frame rate modes. Behavior, performance, and interview results indicated the participants felt anxiety in the pit environment. However, the physiological data did not reflect this anxiety due to factors of user experience and experiment design. Efforts to develop a useful AR test bed and to identify results from a large data set has produced a body of knowledge related to AR evaluation that can inform others seeking to create AR experiments.},

We apply our results in a second study with dyads where one player had a mobility disability and used a wheelchair. By making motion-based games accessible for people with different physical abilities, and by enabling people with mobility disabilities to compete on a par with able-bodied peers, we show how to provide empowering experiences through enjoyable games that have the potential to increase physical activity and self-esteem.},

Psychophysiological analysis provides a unique insight into affective states arising from the demands of climbing, and the impact that they have on performance. This review provides an overview of climbing psychophysiology research completed to date. To summarise, an on-sight lead ascent of a route elicits the greatest psychophysiological response in climbers, whilst a red-point top-rope ascent produces the least. The effects of climbing stimuli on an individual's performance appear to be conditional on their experience. In general, experienced climbers show superior performance and are less anxious than their less practiced counterparts, with significantly lower cognitive and somatic anxiety, increased self-confidence and lower values of the steroid stress hormone cortisol. It is likely that the experience\textendash stressor\textendash performance relationship is due to advanced climbers' greater understanding of the risks associated with the sport, their habituation to the stressors gained through practice and their ability to perform well with higher levels of anxiety. This review outlines pertinent psychological climbing stimuli, summarises current methodologies and presents a detailed review of climbing psychophysiology research. It also concludes with suggestions for improving the depth and breadth of future research, including the need for the refinement of existing measures.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Athletes and members of the public increasingly rely on wearable HR monitors to guide physical activity and training. The accuracy of newer, optically based monitors is unconfirmed. We sought to assess the accuracy of five optically based HR monitors during various types of aerobic exercise.
METHODS: Fifty healthy adult volunteers (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 38 {$\pm$} 12 yr, 54\% female) completed exercise protocols on a treadmill, a stationary bicycle, and an elliptical trainer ({$\pm$}arm movement). Each participant underwent HR monitoring with an electrocardiogaphic chest strap monitor (Polar H7), forearm monitor (Scosche Rhythm+), and two randomly assigned wrist-worn HR monitors (Apple Watch, Fitbit Blaze, Garmin Forerunner 235, and TomTom Spark Cardio), one on each wrist. For each exercise type, HR was recorded at rest, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity. Agreement between HR measurements was assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rc).
RESULTS: Across all exercise conditions, the chest strap monitor (Polar H7) had the best agreement with ECG (rc = 0.996) followed by the Apple Watch (rc = 0.92), the TomTom Spark (rc = 0.83), and the Garmin Forerunner (rc = 0.81). Scosche Rhythm+ and Fitbit Blaze were less accurate (rc = 0.75 and rc = 0.67, respectively). On treadmill, all devices performed well (rc = 0.88-0.93) except the Fitbit Blaze (rc = 0.76). While bicycling, only the Garmin, Apple Watch, and Scosche Rhythm+ had acceptable agreement (rc {$>$} 0.80). On the elliptical trainer without arm levers, only the Apple Watch was accurate (rc = 0.94). None of the devices was accurate during elliptical trainer use with arm levers (all rc {$<$} 0.80).
CONCLUSION: The accuracy of wearable, optically based HR monitors varies with exercise type and is greatest on the treadmill and lowest on elliptical trainer. Electrode-containing chest monitors should be used when accurate HR measurement is imperative.},

  abstract = {In the last years, the need for enhancing health and preventing problems with remote monitoring is increasing. A non-invasive low-cost technique for processing bio-signals and monitoring vital parameters, at rest and during physical activity, is the use of wearable PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) systems. However, in order to detect a relevant vital parameter, such as the heart rate during demanding exercises, motion artifacts must be removed from the signals retrieved. In this paper, we present a fast and easy to implement algorithm to estimate the heart rate value which does not need to reconstruct the noise-free signal nor does it apply adaptive filtering as existing algorithms, thus gaining computational time and stored memory space. The method consists of applying the Fast Fourier Transform on short windows of data and removing motion artifacts relying on single-sided amplitude spectrum analysis of PPG and 3-axis accelerometer signals. The results show that our algorithm manages to remove a wide range of motion artifacts achieving an average absolute error of only 1.27 BPM between the heart rate estimated by the algorithm every second and the ground-truth value. The method was successfully implemented on a wearable PPG device achieving an execution time of 226 ms per second, hence obtaining a battery lifetime of 9.37 days.},

  abstract = {Background
Dissociative states during psychotherapy sessions reduce the benefit of exposure-based therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thus, in evidence-based therapeutic programs such as dialectical behavior therapy for PTSD (DBT-PTSD), therapists apply specific antidissociative skills to reduce dissociative features during in sensu exposure., In addition to therapist-guided sessions, exposure protocols often require that the patients listen to audio recordings of exposure sessions in self-management. The problem of how to prevent dissociative features during such self-administered exposure exercises has not been resolved yet., Hence, we developed the computer program MORPHEUS that supports the application of self-administered exposure exercises. MORPHEUS continuously monitors the level of dissociative states and offers state-related antidissociative skills.

Objective
This study sought to examine the acceptance and feasibility of the MORPHEUS program.

Methods
Patients who underwent 12 weeks of residential DBT-PTSD treatment used MORPHEUS during exposure exercises in self-management. After the treatment, they filled out evaluation questionnaires.

Results
In sum, 26 patients receiving a 12-week standard DBT-PTSD program participated in this study; 2 participants could not be analyzed because of missing data. All the patients used MORPHEUS as often as it was required according to the DBT-PTSD treatment (2 to 5 times a week). The overall acceptance and feasibility as rated by the patients was high: for example, patients found the skills useful to block dissociation (mean 4.24 on a scale from 0 to 5, SD 0.24) and stated that they would use the program again (mean 4.72 on a scale from 0 to 5, SD 0.11). Furthermore, patients indicated that they would recommend MORPHEUS to a friend (mean 4.44 on a scale from 0 to 5, SD 0.12). In 82\% (32/39) of the cases, the use of antidissociative skills was related to a decrease in dissociation. In 18\% (5/39), dissociation remained unchanged or increased.

Conclusions
The evaluative data suggest high acceptability and feasibility of MORPHEUS. Further studies should evaluate the effectiveness of the skills applied during the program.

This exposure process may be done through actual exposure, with visualization, by imagination or using virtual reality (VR), that provides users with computer simulated environments with and within which they can interact. VR is made possible by the capability of computers to synthesize a 3D graphical environment from numerical data. Furthermore, because input devices sense the subject's reactions and motions, the computer can modify the synthetic environment accordingly, creating the illusion of interacting with, and thus being immersed within the environment. Starting from 1995, different experimental studies have been conducted in order to investigate the effect of VR exposure in the treatment of subclinical fears and anxiety disorders. This review will discuss their outcome and provide guidelines for the use of VR exposure for the treatment of anxious patients.},

Whilst there was no significant decrease in climbing distance during the dual-task condition, climbing efficiency was impaired, as was word recall. Participants' Energetic Arousal, Tense Arousal and Task-unrelated Thoughts (TUTs) all changed dependent on the condition, with arousal increasing after the climbing conditions, and TUTs decreasing after the memory-load conditions. These results could be expanded on in future research to examine the physical and cognitive demands of high-angle climbing in greater detail.},

In this experiment, we examined the performance of climbers in a dual climbing and word memory task, in which they were asked to recall fear-related or neutral words after the climb, as well as single-task performance. Climbing distance, efficiency, and word recall all significantly decreased in the dual-task conditions, relative to the single tasks. Climbing distance and efficiency also decreased in the fear word dual task, relative to the neutral word memory dual task. Subjective measures of performance indicated that climbers were aware of impaired climbing performance in the dual tasks, relative to the climbing-only condition, but that they were not aware of the increased impairment caused by the fear words. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly in occupational settings requiring climbing-like operations, such as fire-fighting and search and rescue.},

The purpose of this review is to outline the current state of virtual reality research in the treatment of mental health problems.MethodsPubMed and PsycINFO were searched for all articles containing the words ``virtual reality''. In addition a manual search of the references contained in the papers resulting from this search was conducted and relevant periodicals were searched. Studies reporting the results of treatment utilizing VR in the mental health field and involving at least one patient were identified.ResultsMore than 50 studies using VR were identified, the majority of which were case studies. Seventeen employed a between groups design: 4 involved patients with fear of flying; 3 involved patients with fear of heights; 3 involved patients with social phobia/public speaking anxiety; 2 involved people with spider phobia; 2 involved patients with agoraphobia; 2 involved patients with body image disturbance and 1 involved obese patients. There are both advantages in terms of delivery and disadvantages in terms of side effects to using VR. Although virtual reality based therapy appears to be superior to no treatment the effectiveness of VR therapy over traditional therapeutic approaches is not supported by the research currently available.ConclusionsThere is a lack of good quality research on the effectiveness of VR therapy. Before clinicians will be able to make effective use of this emerging technology greater emphasis must be placed on controlled trials with clinically identified populations.},

The present research advances an evolutionary account of risk-taking behavior in that one of its main functions is to get access to potential mating partners. Inasmuch as reproductive competition among men is more pronounced than among women, men in particular are expected to take risks in order to gain sexual access to women. In fact, four studies revealed that activating a mating goal was associated with men's propensity to risk-taking. Across a wide range of different risk-taking domains, a romantic motive increased men's reported willingness to take risks. In contrast, women's risk-taking was not affected by activating a mating motive. These findings suggest that risk-taking behavior has (in part) been evolved to enhance an individual's ability to attract a mate.},

The subjects were first taught to self-report their cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence levels as a single integer on a scale from 1 (low) to 27 (high). These single integer scales were then used to monitor levels of cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence, together with physiological arousal (operationalized as heart rate), prior to each putt during a Stapleford golf competition. All data was standardized within subjects in order to control for individual differences in response sensitivity and putting ability. Preliminary examination of the results suggested that the catastrophe models were superior to the multidimensional anxiety theory models, and that the inclusion of self-confidence significantly improved the goodness of fit of both models. However, further tests of other control models suggested that the apparent superiority of the catstrophe models was probably due to the inclusion of a temporal factor in Guastello's method of dynamic differences. It was concluded that the results do not offer any clear evidence for the superiority of either catastrophe or multidimensional anxiety theory based models of anxiety and performance. They do suggest that self-confidence is an important factor in performance which is at least partially independent of cognitive anxiety. They also suggest that future research might benefit considering performance as an ongoing temporal process rather than a discrete event.},

In each study, the effort due only to the physical exertion of climbing was controlled for. Anxiety, effort, and performance were measured via self-report, an integrated heart rate measure, and belayer observation. Consistent with processing efficiency theory, the results showed that higher levels of anxiety were usually associated with higher levels of effort and commensurately higher levels of performance. However, the results also suggested that cognitive anxiety may not be the prime determinant of the effort and performance changes observed. Finally, the results suggested that other individual difference variables may play an important part in determining the extent to which individuals may be able to make use of anxiety-induced effort.},

It builds a story about the power of teachers, feedback, and a model of learning and understanding. The research involves many millions of students and represents the largest ever evidence based research into what actually works in schools to improve learning. Areas covered include the influence of the student, home, school, curricula, teacher, and teaching strategies. A model of teaching and learning is developed based on the notion of visible teaching and visible learning.A major message is that what works best for students is similar to what works best for teachers  an attention to setting challenging learning intentions, being clear about what success means, and an attention to learning strategies for developing conceptual understanding about what teachers and students know and understand.Although the current evidence based fad has turned into a debate about test scores, this book is about using evidence to build and defend a model of teaching and learning. A major contribution is a fascinating benchmark/dashboard for comparing many innovations in teaching and schools.},

  abstract = {Computers have dramatically altered life in the late twentieth century. Today we can draw on worldwide computer links, speeding up communications by radio, newspapers, and television. Ideas fly back and forth and circle the globe at the speed of electricity. And just around the corner lurks full-blown virtual reality, in which we will be able to immerse ourselves in a computer simulation not only of the actual physical world, but of any imagined world. As we begin to move in and out of a computer-generated world, Michael Heim asks, how will the way we perceive our world change? In The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, Heim considers this and other philosophical issues of the Information Age. With an eye for the dark as well as the bright side of computer technology, he explores the logical and historical origins of our computer-generated world and speculates about the future direction of our computerized lives. He discusses such topics as the effect of word-processing on the English language (while word-processors have led to increased productivity, they have also led to physical hazards such as repetitive motion syndrome, which causes inflamed hand and arm tendons). Heim looks into the new kind of literacy promised by Hypertext (technology which allows the user to link audio and video elements, the disadvantages including disorientation and cognitive overload). And he also probes the notion of virtual reality, "cyberspace"--the computer-simulated environments that have captured the popular imagination and may ultimately change the way we define reality itself. Just as the definition of interface itself has evolved from the actual adapter plug used to connect electronic circuits into human entry into a self-contained cyberspace, so too will the notion of reality change with the current technological drive. Like the introduction of the automobile, the advent of virtual reality will change the whole context in which our knowledge and awareness of life are rooted. And along the way, Heim covers such intriguing topics as how computers have altered our thought habits, how we will be able to distinguish virtual from real reality, and the appearance of virtual reality in popular culture (as in Star Trek's holodeck, William Gibson's Neuromancer, and Stephen King's Lawnmower Man). Vividly and entertainingly written, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality opens a window on a fascinating world that promises--or threatens--to become an integral part of everyday life in the 21st century. As Heim writes, not only do we face a breakthrough in the technology of computer interface, but we face the challenge of knowing ourselves and determining how the technology should develop and ultimately affect the society in which it grows.},

Salivary cortisol is frequently used as a biomarker of psychological stress. However, psychobiological mechanisms, which trigger the hypothalamus\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal axis (HPAA) can only indirectly be assessed by salivary cortisol measures. The different instances that control HPAA reactivity (hippocampus, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals) and their respective modulators, receptors, or binding proteins, may all affect salivary cortisol measures. Thus, a linear relationship with measures of plasma ACTH and cortisol in blood or urine does not necessarily exist. This is particularly true under response conditions. The present paper addresses several psychological and biological variables, which may account for such dissociations, and aims to help researchers to rate the validity and psychobiological significance of salivary cortisol as an HPAA biomarker of stress in their experiments.},

It is an appeal to this sense of presence that is used to distinguish virtual reality as something different from merely a multimedia system or an interactive computer graphics display. Our basic understanding of presence, however, is still primarily anecdotal in nature. We have yet to rigorously explore basic questions about the nature of presence. We describe an application of virtual reality, virtual reality graded exposure (VRGE), in which a sense of presence is the salient factor determining the success of the application. Subjective and objective data from a clinical study on the usefulness of VRGE for treating persons with acrophobia is analyzed as experimental evidence for formulating several assertions about the characteristics and nature of presence.

Subjects in a `no touch' group picked up a 3D virtual image of a kitchen plate in a VE, using a traditional 3D wand. `See and touch' subjects physically picked up a virtual plate possessing solidity and weight, using a technique called `tactile augmentation'. Afterwards, subjects made predictions about the properties of other virtual objects they saw but did not interact with in the VE. `See and touch' subjects predicted these objects would be more solid, heavier, and more likely to obey gravity than the `no touch' group. In Experiment 2 (a pilot study), subjects `physically bit' a chocolate bar in one condition, and `imagined biting' a chocolate bar in another condition. Subjects rated the event more fun and realistic when allowed to physically bite the chocolate bar. Results of the two experiments converge with a growing literature showing the value of adding physical qualities to virtual objects. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of tactile augmentation as a simple, safe, inexpensive technique with large freedom of motion for adding physical texture, force feedback cues, smell and taste to virtual objects.

To construct and validate a short scale for the assessment of the severity of visual height intolerance (vHI) and acrophobia.

Methods
The questionnaire was developed from two earlier representative epidemiological studies (n\,=\,5,529). Items were applied in a telephone survey of a representative population-based sample.

Results
A total of 1,960 persons were included. The life-time prevalence of vHI was 32.7\% (f: 36.1\%; m: 28.4\%); 12\% of these persons fulfilled the psychiatric criteria of acrophobia. Rasch analysis of 11 items on severity, symptoms, and triggers resulted in an 8-item scale with good fit to the model. The score differentiated well between persons with and without acrophobia. The distribution of the scores on the metric scale of the questionnaires of those individuals with acrophobia is separate and distinct from that of susceptibles without acrophobia, although there is some overlap.

Conclusion
Our proposed short questionnaire (vHISS, see Table  and Supplementary Material) allows a continuous quantification of the severity of vHI within a metric interval scale from 0 to 13. The diagnosis of acrophobia can be established by including two additional questions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic work stress and overtraining are known to influence heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and decreased nocturnal HRV is associated with cardiovascular health and disease. The purpose of this study was to examine whether anticipation of an acute highly stressful event influences HR and HRV during the night and morning.
METHODS: Nocturnal HR and HRV and urinary stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline) as well as HR and HRV responses to an orthostatic test on the morning of a parachute jump day or control day were analyzed from 14 novice and 7 experienced parachute jumpers.
RESULTS: There were no differences in any HRV indices during the night or the orthostatic test between the jump and control situations. The novices had higher HR than experienced jumpers in the orthostatic test in the morning and also during the jump, but no differences were found between the groups in nocturnal HR and HRV indices or HRV indices during the orthostatic test. There were no differences in nocturnal stress hormone secretions except slightly elevated adrenaline secretion during the jump night compared to the control night (P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: The parachute jump did not substantially influence HR, HRV, or stress hormones during the night or the orthostatic test in the morning preceding the jump. The results suggest that the parachute jump as an acute highly stressful event had no anticipatory effect on autonomic modulation of the heart even though both the novices and experienced jumpers had markedly accentuated sympathetic activation during the parachuting.},

However, designing and development of educational games with authentic learning content while maintaining the fun criteria can be challenging. Hence, a good design methodology and guideline is needed in assisting games development team to design an effective learning game. Our main attention is to produce a framework in educational games design for higher education. This paper analyses and compares a few frameworks available, then suggests a few criteria needed both from game design and pedagogy points of view.

  abstract = {One of the most disconcertingly unnatural properties of most virtual environments (VEs) is the ability of the user to pass through objects. I hypothesize that passive haptics, augmenting a high-fidelity visual virtual environment with low-fidelity physical objects, will markedly improve both sense of presence and spatial knowledge training transfer. The low-fidelity physical models can be constructed from cheap, easy-to-assemble materials such as styrofoam, plywood, and particle board. The first study investigated the effects of augmenting a visual-cliff environment with a slight physical ledge on participants' sense of  presence. I found when participants experienced passive haptics in the VE, they exhibited significantly more behaviors associated with pit avoidance than when experiencing the non-augmented VE. Changes in heart rate and skin conductivity were significantly higher than when they experienced the VE without passive haptics. The second study investigated passive haptics' effects on performance of a real-world navigation task after training in a virtual environment. Half of the participants trained on maze navigation in a VE augmented with a styrofoam physical model, while half trained in a non-augmented VE but were given visual and audio contact cues. The task was to gain as much information as possible about the layout of the environment. Participants knew before the VE session that their training would be tested by navigating an identical real maze environment while blindfolded. Significant differences in the time to complete the blindfolded navigation task and significant differences in the number of collisions with objects were found between the participants trained in an augmented VE and the participants trained in a non-augmented VE. 11 of 15 participants trained without passive haptics bumped into the next-to-last obstacle encountered in the testing session and turned the wrong direction to navigate around it: only 2 of 15 participants trained with passive haptics made the same navigation error. On the other hand, the assessment of the participants' cognitive maps of the virtual environment did not find significant differences between groups as measured by sketch maps and object dimension estimation.},

The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

We highlight three central themes of how digital augmentation can contribute to a sport: increasing diversity of movement and challenges, enabling user-created content in an otherwise risky environment, and enabling procedurally generated content. We further discuss how ACW represents an underexplored class of interactive systems, i.e., proximity interaction on wall-sized interactive surfaces, which presents novel human-computer interaction challenges.},

The purpose of this study is to reveal the effects of small latencies on head mounted display users. The subjects in this study were asked to simply and stably stand on a force plate with one foot. The speed of body sway was measured with several lags, from 1 ms to 66 ms, using an Oculus Rift DK2. The results showed that the sway speed increased monotonically with increase in the latency values. The sense of balance is regarded as a relatively direct index of quality of a VR system, including the effects of lag.},

Although it involves symptoms similar to those of motion-induced sickness (MS), SS tends to be less severe, to be of lower incidence, and to originate from elements of visual display and visuo-vestibular interaction atypical of conditions that induce MS. Most studies of SS to date index severity with some variant of the Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ). The MSQ has several deficiencies as an instrument for measuring SS. Some symptoms included in the scoring of MS are irrelevant for SS, and several are misleading. Also, the configural approach of the MSQ is not readily adaptable to computer administration and scoring. This article describes the development of a Simulator Sickness Questiomaire (SSQ), derived from the MSQ using a series of factor analyses, and illustrates its use in monitoring simulator performance with data from a computerized SSQ survey of 3,691 simulator hops. The database used for development included more than 1,100 MSQs, representing data from 10 Navy simulators. The SSQ provides straightforward computer or manual scoring, increased power to identify "problem" simulators, and improved diagnostic capability.},

  abstract = {Background
The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based therapy (Interapy) for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a German speaking population. Also, the quality of the online therapeutic relationship, its development and its relevance as potential moderator of the treatment effects was investigated.

Method
Ninety-six patients with posttraumatic stress reactions were allocated at random to ten sessions of Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) conducted over a 5-week period or a waiting list control group. Severity of PTSD was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome variables were depression, anxiety, dissociation and physical health. Follow-up assessments were conducted at the end of treatment and 3 months after treatment.

Results
From baseline to post-treatment assessment, PTSD severity and other psychopathological symptoms were significantly improved for the treatment group (intent-to-treat group \texttimes{} time interaction effect size d = 1.40). Additionally, patients of the treatment condition showed significantly greater reduction of co-morbid depression and anxiety as compared to the waiting list condition. These effects were sustained during the 3-months follow-up period. High ratings of the therapeutic alliance and low drop-out rates indicated that a positive and stable therapeutic relationship could be established online. Significant improvement of the online working alliance in the course of treatment and a substantial correlation between the quality of the online relationship at the end of treatment and treatment outcome emerged.

Conclusion
Interapy proved to be a viable treatment alternative for PTSD with large effect sizes and sustained treatment effects. A stable and positive online therapeutic relationship can be established through the Internet which improved during the treatment process.

Most people you ask why Virtual Reality became so popular, will tell you because of the sense of presence. The sense of presence people feel when walking around in a virtual world is one of the best known attributes of Virtual Reality. But what is this sense of presence? How can we measure presence?
To find out more about presence, an experiment has been done in which people were treated who suffered from acrophobia, the fear of heights. The results of this experiment could be used to answer the questions from two different fields. The psychologists were glad to see that it was possible to treat people by using Virtual Reality. The computer science people got 5 assertions from this experiment. Using these five assertions, better experiments can be done later to find out more about presence.},

  abstract = {Wearable sports devices like GPS watches and heart rate monitors are ubiquitous in sports like running or road cycling and enable the users to receive real-time performance feedback. Although rock climbing is a trending sport, there are little to no consumer electronics available to support rock climbing training during exercise. In this paper, we investigated the acceptance and appropriateness of wearables in climbing on different body parts. Based on an online survey with 54 climbers, we designed a wearable device and conducted a perception study with 12 participants in a climbing gym. Using vibro-tactile, audible, and visual cues while climbing an easy route and a hard route, requiring high physical and cognitive load, we found that the most suited notification channel is sound, directly followed by vibro-tactile output. Light has been found to be inappropriate for the use in the sport of climbing.},

  abstract = {Rock climbing involves complex movements and therefore requires guidance when acquiring a new technique. The classic approach is mimicking the movements of a more experienced climber. However, the trainee has to remember every nuance of the climb, since the sequence of movements cannot be performed in parallel to the experienced climber. As a solution to this problem, we present a video recording and replay system for climbing. The replay component allows for different in-situ video feedback methods. We investigated the video feedback component of the system by studying two example visualization techniques, i.e. a life-sized in-place projection and a real-time third-person view of the climber, augmented by a video showing a successful ascent. The latter is presented to the user on both Google Glass and a projected display. The results indicate that a life-sized projection was perceived as easiest to follow, while most of the climbers had problems with the context switches between the augmented video and the climbing wall. These findings can aid in the design of assistance systems that teach complex movements.},

Fear of flying treatment methods: virtual reality exposure vs. cognitive behavioral therapy. Aviat Space Environ Med 2007; 78:121\textendash 128. Introduction: Fear of flying (FOF) can be a serious problem for individuals who develop this condition and for military and civilian organizations that operate aircraft. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three treatments: bibliotherapy (BIB) without therapist contact; individualized virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE); and cognitive behavior therapy (CB). In addition, we evaluated the effect of following up VRE and CB with 2 d of group cognitive-behavioral training (GrCB). Methods: There were 86 subjects suffering from FOF who entered the study; 19 BIB, 29 VRE, and 16 CB subjects completed the treatment protocols. The BIB subjects were then treated with VRE (n = 7) or CB (n = 12). There were 59 subjects who were then trained with GrCB. Results: Treatment with VRE or CB was more effective than BIB. Both VRE and CB showed a decline in FOF on the two main outcome measures. There was no statistically significant difference between those two therapies. However, effect sizes were lower for VRE (small to moderate) than for CB (moderate) and the addition of GrCB had less effect for VRE than for CB. Discussion: VRE holds promise as treatment for FOF, but in this trial CB followed by GrCB showed the largest decrease in subjective anxiety. The results suggest that future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness of VRE vs. VRE plus cognitive techniques or measure the effectiveness of each component of treatment. Moreover, the effectiveness of the GrCB as stand-alone treatment should be investigated, which might even be superior in cost-effectiveness.},

While elite climbers receive intensive expert coaching to refine this skill set, this progression approach is not viable for the amateur population. We have developed ClimbAX - a climbing performance analysis system that aims for replicating expert assessments and thus represents a first step towards an automatic coaching system for climbing enthusiasts. Through an accelerometer based wearable sensing platform, climber's movements are captured. An automatic analysis procedure detects climbing sessions and moves, which form the basis for subsequent performance assessment. The assessment parameters are derived from sports science literature and include: power, control, stability, speed. ClimbAX was evaluated in a large case study with 53 climbers under competition settings. We report a strong correlation between predicted scores and official competition results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our automatic skill assessment system.},

The interactive environment contains instructions for a scoring procedure for quantitatively analyzing the medical condition of the patient, and/or counseling instructions or self-help instructions. The environment can be used in conjunction with a physical parameter measuring device (36) connected to the virtual reality technology unit (10). The process is comprehensive and takes place during immersion in fully interactive three-dimensional virtual reality environments utilizing computer generated graphics, images imported from photographs, and video for sensory stimulation. Immersion is achieved with goggles, a head-mounted-display, or other form of visual stimulation, such as surround projection screens or monitors or devices that permit the user to have a virtual experience. It includes the use of voice, music, and sound and other forms of physiological stimulation and feedback.

Analysis of the operation span task revealed significant impairments in both storage and processing capacities of working memory prior to jumping. Storage capacity continued to be impaired in novice parachutists on landing whilst experienced parachutists showed full recovery. Neither group showed impairment in processing capacity on landing. Significant increases in heart rate were found for both groups in the jump and landing conditions compared to baseline but no differences existed between novices and experienced parachutists. Initial analyses support processing efficiency theory and suggest that cognitive processing may be slowing down during a jump. However, post hoc analysis of incorrect responses suggest that executive function may actually become disrupted. The results are reviewed in the context of `no pull' parachuting fatalities.

In an attempt to measure this entity, various definitions have evolved. Tinetti and Powell3 described FOF as an ongoing concern about falling that ultimately limits the performance of daily activities. Other authors4,5 have referred to FOF as a patient's loss of confidence in his or her balance abilities.

It asks and answers an intriguing question: why are animals in the wild, though threatened routinely, rarely traumatized? By understanding the dynamics that make wild animals virtually immune to traumatic symptoms, the mystery of human trauma is revealed.Waking the Tiger normalizes the symptoms of trauma and the steps needed to heal them. People are often traumatized by seemingly ordinary experiences. The reader is taken on a guided tour of the subtle, yet powerful impulses that govern our responses to overwhelming life events. To do this, it employs a series of exercises that help us focus on bodily sensations. Through heightened awareness of these sensations trauma can be healed.},

Two studies were carried out to explore this relationship. The first study, using a time-to-event paradigm, showed that a higher level of self-focused attention accompanied increased anxiety levels in the buildup to competition. In the second study, basketball novices who were instructed to focus on the mechanics of the ball-shooting process during practice suffered a significant performance decrement in a subsequent stressful test phase, whereas those who were required only to do their best during practice showed no degradation in performance. It was concluded that self-focused attention may increase in response to psychological stress, and that the negative effect of self-focused attention on performance under stress is likely to be magnified by learning the skill under a high degree of self-focused attention, which can result in an overawareness of the performance process.},

Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic ``Big Data'' that promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.},

Two-hundred and one active rock climbers (163 male) aged 16\textendash 62 years were recruited at five outdoor and six indoor climbing venues in Britain in a retrospective study. The relationship of self-efficacy to the frequency and difficulty of high and medium risk rock climbing behaviors was modelled using linear regression. Climbers high in self-efficacy engaged in both high and medium risk forms of rock climbing more frequently ({$\beta\geqslant$}0.18, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.04\textendash 0.32) and at a higher level of difficulty ({$\beta\geqslant$}0.20, 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.36). These associations were attenuated slightly with adjustment for covariates, though all remained significant. The same pattern of associations was observed for climbers recruited at indoor and outdoor venues, and for male and female climbers. Rock climbers may therefore participate more frequently, take calculated additional risks and attempt harder climbs when they feel confident in their abilities and are high in self-efficacy. Researchers should not assume psychological or behavioral homogeneity within risk taking populations.},

It begins by noting practical and theoretical reasons for studying this concept. Six conceptualizations of presence found in a diverse set of literatures are identified and a detailed explication of the concept that incorporates these conceptualizations is presented. Existing research and speculation about the factors that encourage or discourage a sense of presence in media users as well as the physiological and psychological effects of presence are then outlined.

Usage of wearable wireless physiological monitoring system has been extensively increasing during the last decade. These mobile devices can continuously measure e.g. the heart activity and wirelessly transfer the data to the mobile phone of the patient. One of the significant restrictions for these devices is usage of energy, which leads to requiring low sampling rate. This article is presented in order to investigate the lowest adequate sampling frequency of ECG signal, for achieving accurate enough time domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. For this purpose the ECG signals originally measured with high 5 kHz sampling rate were down-sampled to simulate the measurement with lower sampling rate. Down-sampling loses information, decreases temporal accuracy, which was then restored by interpolating the signals to their original sampling rates. The HRV parameters obtained from the ECG signals with lower sampling rates were compared. The results represent that even when the sampling rate of ECG signal is equal to 50 Hz, the HRV parameters are almost accurate with a reasonable error.},

  abstract = {Computer science is continuously evolving during the past decades. This has also brought forth new knowledge that should be incorporated and new learning strategies must be adopted for the successful teaching of all sub-domains. For example, computer programming is a vital knowledge area within computer science with constantly changing curriculum and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour. On the other hand, students start from a very early age to interact with computers through games and other entertaining multimedia software. Therefore, they seem to be keen on environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they interact with the environment's elements. In response, teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with computer operations that students are familiar with, which does not include textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction. Educational games used in computer programming courses are considered to benefit learning, because they motivate students towards actively participating and interacting with the game's activities. Thus, we have developed an educational multiplayer game that aims to further enhance computer programming education by addressing occurring problems. This process, however, requires proper planning during the design of educational games, and thus the availability of adequate guidelines that include all characteristics that should be incorporated in such games. This paper aims to introduce and elaborate on a holistic framework that has been constructed as a guide towards the development of this game. To this end, we study existing frameworks that have been proposed for the design of educational games and document features currently supported by educational games that teach computer programming. We conclusively propose the framework we have constructed for the design of our game. This framework can be used for the design of other computer programming-specific educational games and extended for other educational domains.},

More detailed descriptions of the experiments and the theory on which this paper is based are given by Malone (1980a, 1980b). My primary goal here is to provide a set of heuristics or guidelines for designers of instructional computer games. I have articulated and organized common sense principles to spark the creativity of instructional designers (see Banet, 1979, for an unstructured list of similar principles). To demonstrate the usefulness of these principles, I have included several applications to actual or proposed instructional games. Throughout the paper I emphasize games with educational uses, but I focus on what makes the games fun, not on what makes them educational. Though I will not emphasize the point in this paper, these same ideas can be applied to other educational environments and life situations. In a sense, the categories I will describe constitute a general taxonomy of intrinsic motivation\textemdash of what makes an activity fun or rewarding for its own sake rather than for the sake of some external reward (See Lepper and Greene, 1979). I think the essential characteristics of good computer games and other intrinsically enjoyable situations can be organized into three categories: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity.},

To support this contention, the basic assumptions of orthodox science are examined, with the doctrine of objectivity singled out as fallacious and especially harmful in that it attempts to remove the person from the process of knowing. Polanyi's (1958) heuristic philosophy of knowledge, which places humans in the center of the process of knowing, is recommended as an alternative approach for the study of human behavior. This alternative approach reveals the inadequacy of the laboratory experiment which has been invented primarily to pursue the doctrine of objectivity. Next, the Degrees of Knowledge theory is proposed as an alternative way to view the reliability of knowledge. This view, within the heuristic paradigm, places great significance on experiential knowledge. Recommendations for an improved science of human behavior emphasizes the idiographic approach, introspective methods, and field studies. Also, recommendations are made for a more progressive approach to applied research, and the significance of knowledge synthesis from applied research. The two sport psychologies will converge when orthodox science and the doctrine of objectivity are replaced with the heuristic paradigm and its emphasis on experiential knowledge.},

  abstract = {The first objective was to examine the extent to which climbers' climbing safety perceived competence (CSPC) and perceived own absolute (POAR) and comparative (PCR) risk of getting seriously injured whilst climbing is related to risk exposure. The second objective was to examine which variables influence POAR and PCR. Two hundred and thirty-five climbers (M=32, SD=10.2 years of age) completed the following questionnaires: a CSPC scale specifically developed to assess perceived ability to practice climbing safely; indirect measures of PCR, consisting in the subtraction of the participants' assessment of their own risks from their assessment of other climbing referents' risks; and the Life Orientation Test-Revised, measuring dispositional optimism (DO). Participants were approached in their practices sites from Mediterranean regions, and were divided into groups based on their climbing practice's risk exposure; that is, high risk: traditional climbing (TRAD; n=42); moderate risk: leading (LEAD; n=89); and low risk: either top-roping (TOP; n=51) or indoor bouldering (IND; n=53). Analyses of variance showed that TRAD expressed higher CSPC and higher POAR than the other groups. PCR also differed amongst the groups. More specifically, TRAD expressed comparative pessimism and LEAD expressed comparative optimism, as their POAR was, respectively, higher and lower than their perceived average climber's risk. TOP and IND perceived their own risk in a similar way to that of the average climber. Regression analyses showed that DO did not influence POAR or PCR. Past injury episode was positively related to POAR and negatively related to the propensity to express comparative optimism, though only amongst TRAD and LEAD. Climbers' risk perception accurately reflected their risk exposure. Climbers whose climbing modality involves higher risks acknowledged so when evaluating their own absolute and comparative risks of getting seriously injured whilst climbing.},

We also examined which variables influence perceived comparative VSI. High-risk and moderate-risk sports participants (n = 432) completed measures of perceived personal AMR, perceived comparative AMR and VSI, and motive of playing to the limit. Results showed that high-risk sports practitioners perceived their VSI as being higher than the average sports participant, while moderate-risk practitioners perceived their VSI as being lower. Perceived comparative VSI was negatively related to perceived personal AMR and positively related to past injury episode, sporting experience, and playing to the limit. In conclusion, perceived comparative risks were similarly realistic amongst high-risk sports practitioners. Future research is needed to further examine the role that perceived comparative risks play in the risk-taking decision-making process},

This is a challenging problem because the PPG signals recorded from wrist during exercise are contaminated by strong Motion Artifacts (MAs). In this work, a novel algorithm is proposed which consists of two main steps of MA Cancellation and Spectral Analysis. The MA cancellation step cleanses the MA-contaminated PPG signals utilizing the acceleration data and the spectral analysis step estimates a higher resolution spectrum of the signal and selects the spectral peaks corresponding to HR. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/hour showed that the proposed algorithm achieves an average absolute error of 1.25 beat per minute (BPM). These experimental results also confirm that the proposed algorithm keeps high estimation accuracies even in strong MA conditions.},

Reinvestment Theory argues that the propensity for consciousness to control movements on-line is a function of individual personality differences, specific contexts and a broad range of contingent events that can be psychological, physiological, environmental or even mechanical.},

Acrophobia, the most severe form of visual height intolerance, has a life-time prevalence of around 5\%. Although it is commonly believed that fear of heights should continuously aggravate with increasing elevation, this issue has not been systematically investigated yet. Here, we examined this topic using immersive virtual reality, an established tool in therapy for fear of heights, that allows to flexibly manipulate height stimuli. In a comprehensive cohort (including insusceptible subjects as well as subjects with height intolerance up to acrophobia) height intolerance severity was graded by an established metric scale (vHISS). Participants were randomly exposed to different virtual elevations using a head-mounted display. Behavioral responses to virtual height exposure were analogous to exposure in vivo. Participants exhibited increased anxiety and musculoskeletal stiffening with enhanced high-frequency body sway, to an extend that corresponded to the individual subjective height intolerance rating. For all behavioral responses, we observed a saturation above a certain altitude. Body sway and musculoskeletal stiffening became maximal at 20 m above ground, whereas anxiety saturated above 40 m. These results suggest that fear of heights is characterized by a nonlinear stimulus\textendash response relationship and a dissociation between visual-height-induced bodily and emotional reactions.},

First, climbing has a strong emotional impact on beginners; therefore, learning to climb requires mastering new motor patterns as well as negative emotions, such as stress and fear. Second, the feeling of danger that climbers often experience can be mitigated by trust in the climbing partner and the perception of her active presence. Finally, a big problem in climbing is the communication difficulty between the climbing partners and between climber and instructor. We conclude the paper presenting four design considerations for the design of wearable devices meant to support the learning of climbing by providing the actors involved with augmented communication. Such augmented communication should address both the physical and the emotional difficulties of this sport.},

  abstract = {Background
Self-guided, Web-based interventions for depression show promising results but suffer from high attrition and low user engagement. Online peer support networks can be highly engaging, but they show mixed results and lack evidence-based content.

Objective
Our aim was to introduce and evaluate a novel Web-based, peer-to-peer cognitive reappraisal platform designed to promote evidence-based techniques, with the hypotheses that (1) repeated use of the platform increases reappraisal and reduces depression and (2) that the social, crowdsourced interactions enhance engagement.

Methods
Participants aged 18-35 were recruited online and were randomly assigned to the treatment group, ``Panoply'' (n=84), or an active control group, online expressive writing (n=82). Both are fully automated Web-based platforms. Participants were asked to use their assigned platform for a minimum of 25 minutes per week for 3 weeks. Both platforms involved posting descriptions of stressful thoughts and situations. Participants on the Panoply platform additionally received crowdsourced reappraisal support immediately after submitting a post (median response time=9 minutes). Panoply participants could also practice reappraising stressful situations submitted by other users. Online questionnaires administered at baseline and 3 weeks assessed depression symptoms, reappraisal, and perseverative thinking. Engagement was assessed through self-report measures, session data, and activity levels.

Results
The Panoply platform produced significant improvements from pre to post for depression (P=.001), reappraisal (P{$<$}.001), and perseverative thinking (P{$<$}.001). The expressive writing platform yielded significant pre to post improvements for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P{$<$}.001), but not reappraisal (P=.45). The two groups did not diverge significantly at post-test on measures of depression or perseverative thinking, though Panoply users had significantly higher reappraisal scores (P=.02) than expressive writing. We also found significant group by treatment interactions. Individuals with elevated depression symptoms showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P=.008). Individuals with baseline reappraisal deficits showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.002) and perseverative thinking (P=.002). Changes in reappraisal mediated the effects of Panoply, but not the expressive writing platform, for both outcomes of depression (ab=-1.04, SE 0.58, 95\% CI -2.67 to -.12) and perseverative thinking (ab=-1.02, SE 0.61, 95\% CI -2.88 to -.20). Dropout rates were similar for the two platforms; however, Panoply yielded significantly more usage activity (P{$<$}.001) and significantly greater user experience scores (P{$<$}.001).

Conclusions
Panoply engaged its users and was especially helpful for depressed individuals and for those who might ordinarily underutilize reappraisal techniques. Further investigation is needed to examine the long-term effects of such a platform and whether the benefits generalize to a more diverse population of users.

  abstract = {Objective: We examined the effects of several display characteristics of head-mounted displays (HMDs) on simulator sickness (SS)., Background: Technological limitations, such as display delay and reduced field of view (FOV), affect perception when using an HMD and are often thought to be related to SS. Few studies have examined the relationship between FOV and geometric FOV (image scale factor) or how HMD characteristics may interact., Method: Participants made active head movements to locate objects when viewing a live video via an HMD., Results: Compared with no added delay, an additional 200 ms of display delay did not result in increased SS, as measured by the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Furthermore, an effect of image scale factor on SS was not revealed. However, SS was greater when peripheral vision was occluded than when it was not. Peripheral vision moderated the effects of image scale factor and delay on head movement velocity., Conclusion: Occluding peripheral vision may subject HMD users to the potential detrimental consequences of HMD characteristics more than when peripheral vision of the external environment is available, resulting in more SS. Future research should investigate to what extent peripheral vision can be occluded without increasing SS and without sacrificing realism and presence., Application: To reduce the occurrence of SS, a degree of peripheral vision of the external world should be provided. Furthermore, users and designers should be aware that head movement behavior may be affected by HMD characteristics.},

Fear of flying was assessed before, immediately after, and 6 months after treatment. Posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments revealed reduced fear of flying only in the VR exposure groups. VR exposure with or without motion simulation yielded comparable treatment outcomes. Dismantling of treatment components indicated that exposure to visual and acoustic stimuli is the main active component of VR exposure therapy. Motion simulation as part of VR exposure does not seem to further enhance treatment effects.},

Following the feedback the subjects were asked to disclose their emotions. The following emotions were listed on the display of the monitoring device: no emotion, happiness, anger, anxiety/fear, sadness, surprise, and disgust. The frequency and quality of the emotions were not different between event-related and random feedbacks, indicating that the subjects were not able to discriminate between events with and without additional heart rate correctly. Accordingly, the physiological profiles of the differing emotions compared to conditions with ``no emotion'' were equivocal. The psychological ratings of excitement and enjoyment, however, came up to expectations. The results show that cognitive schemata and personality dimensions are more important in emotion perception than physiological activation.},

However, research also suggests that the therapeutic alliance is a central predictor of therapy outcome. Interestingly, amounts of therapist contact within and across ``self-help'' interventions vary greatly. It is therefore unclear how much therapist contact is necessary for a positive anxiety disorder treatment outcome. The present article reviews the literature on anxiety disorder treatments using self-help, self-administered, and decreased therapist-contact interventions. Treatment studies are grouped together by anxiety diagnosis as well as amount of therapist contact. It is concluded that self-administered treatments are most effective for motivated clients seeking treatment for simple phobias. Predominantly self-help therapies are efficacious for panic disorder and mixed anxiety samples. On the other hand, minimal-contact therapies have demonstrated efficacy for the greatest variety of anxiety diagnoses. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, surprisingly few therapists use exposure therapy in the clinical setting. Although the limited use of exposure-based treatments may be partially attributable to a shortage of suitably trained therapists, exposure therapy also suffers from a ``public relations problem'' predicated upon concerns that it is cruel and at odds with some ethical considerations (e.g., first do no harm). This article provides an overview of ethical issues and considerations relevant to the use of exposure therapy. It is argued that the degree to which ethical issues become problematic in implementing exposure-based treatments is largely dependent upon the therapist's ability to create an adequately safe and professional context. Specific strategies that may be employed for avoiding potential ethical conflicts in the use of exposure-based treatments are discussed.},

  abstract = {BackgroundClimbing is a physical activity and sport involving many subdisciplines. Minimization of prolonged pauses, use of a relatively simple path through a route and smooth transitions between movements broadly define skilled coordination in climbing.ObjectivesTo provide an overview of the constraints on skilled coordination in climbing and to explore future directions in this emerging field.MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted in 2014 and retrieved studies reporting perceptual and movement data during climbing tasks. To be eligible for the qualitative synthesis, studies were required to report perceptual or movement data during climbing tasks graded for difficulty.ResultsQualitative synthesis of 42 studies was carried out, showing that skilled coordination in climbing is underpinned by superior perception of climbing opportunities; optimization of spatial\textendash temporal features pertaining to body-to-wall coordination, the climb trajectory and hand-to-hold surface contact; and minimization of exploratory behaviour. Improvements in skilled coordination due to practice are related to task novelty and the difficulty of the climbing route relative to the individual's ability level.ConclusionPerceptual and motor adaptations that improve skilled coordination are highly significant for improving the climbing ability level. Elite climbers exhibit advantages in detection and use of climbing opportunities when visually inspecting a route from the ground and when physically moving though a route. However, the need to provide clear guidelines on how to improve climbing skill arises from uncertainties regarding the impacts of different practice interventions on learning and transfer.},

  abstract = {In this review of research on climbing expertise, we focus on different measures of climbing performance, including spatiotemporal measures related to fluency and activity states (i.e., discrete actions), adopted by climbers for achieving overall performance goals of getting to the end of a route efficiently and safely. Currently, a broad range of variables have been reported, however, many of these fail to capture how climbers adapt to a route whilst climbing. We argue that spatiotemporal measures should be considered concurrently with evaluation of activity states (such as reaching or exploring) in order gain a more comprehensive picture of how climbers successfully adapt to a route. Spatial and temporal movement measures taken at the hip are a traditional means of assessing efficiency of climbing behaviors. More recently, performatory and exploratory actions of the limbs have been used in combination with spatiotemporal indicators, highlighting the influence of limb states on climbing efficiency and skill transfer. However, only a few studies have attempted to combine spatiotemporal and activity state measures taken during route climbing. This review brings together existing approaches for observing climbing skill at performance outcome (i.e., spatiotemporal assessments) and process (i.e., limb activity states) levels of analysis. Skill level is associated with a spatially efficient route progression and lower levels of immobility. However, more difficult hold architecture designs require significantly greater mobility and more complex movement patterning to maintain performance. Different forms of functional, or goal-supportive, movement variability, including active recovery and hold exploration, have been implicated as important adaptations to physiological and environmental dynamics that emerge during the act of climbing. Indeed, recently it has also been shown that, when climbing on new routes, efficient exploration can improve the transfer of skill. This review provides new insights into how climbing performance and related actions can be quantified to better capture the functional role of movement variability.},

One way of testing whether multiple affordances and their displacement influence the formation of a motor simulation is to study acquired motor skills. We used a behavioral task in which expert and novice rock climbers were shown three routes: an easy route, a route impossible to climb but perceptually salient, and a difficult route. After a distraction task, they were then given a recall test in which they had to write down the sequence of holds composing each route. We found no difference between experts and novices on the easy and impossible routes, whereas on the difficult route, the performance of experts was better than that of novices. This suggests that seeing a climbing wall activates a motor, embodied simulation, which relies not on perceptual salience, but on motor competence. More importantly, our results show that the capability to form this simulation is modulated by individuals' motor repertoire and expertise, and that this strongly impacts recall.},

In this paper, we describe an evaluation study for two wrist-worn devices, namely PulseOn (PO) and Empatica E4 (E4), measuring photoplethysmography \textendash{} based heart rate (PPG HR) and inter-beat intervals (IBIs). The accuracy and reliability of PPG HR and beat-to-beat detection are evaluated with respect to electrocardiography (ECG) \textendash{} based HR and IBIs during different daily activities, such as sitting, standing, household work and cycling. The evaluation study employed data from twenty male subjects. The absolute difference of PPG and ECG HR was less than 10 bpm for 90-99\% and 81-97\% of time for PO and E4, respectively. The accuracy and reliability of the devices were decreased during household work due to the excess hand movements. On average, the mean absolute error in HR was 2.5 bpm higher in PO and 3.7 bpm higher in E4 during household work than during sitting. The percentage of correctly detected heartbeats was 89\% for PO and 68\% for E4 during sitting but 76\% for PO and only 9\% for E4 during household work. PO showed better beat-to-beat detection accuracy than E4 in all activities. The errors in heart rate variability measure (HRV) of root mean square of successive inter-beat interval differences were 3.5{$\pm$}3.9 ms for PO and 10.2{$\pm$}6.7 ms for E4 during sitting, but 18.0{$\pm$}10.9 ms for PO and 48.7{$\pm$}21.8 ms for E4 during cycling. As a conclusion, PPG \textendash{} based wrist-worn devices are accurate and reliable for HR and beat-to-beat detection when the amount of hand movements is not excess but HRV can be estimated from PPG IBI data reliably only during resting conditions. Moreover, there were significant differences in accuracy between different devices.},

Design: In Experiment 1 we investigated the manifestations of state anxiety at the first two levels by comparing low- and high-anxiety conditions during climbing. In Experiment 2 we explored behavioural differences under these conditions. Methods: We manipulated anxiety by using a climbing wall with routes defined at different heights (low and high). Participants were 13 and 17 novice climbers in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively (ages 19\textendash 30 years). We measured self-reported state anxiety, heart rate (Experiments 1 and 2), blood lactate concentration and muscle fatigue (Experiment 1), and climbing time and fluency of movements (Experiment 2). Results: At the level of subjective experience we found that when novices climbed a route high on a climbing wall they reported significantly more anxiety than when they traversed an identical route low on the climbing wall. At the physiological level, they exhibited significantly higher heart rates, more muscle fatigue, and higher blood lactate concentrations. The results of Experiment 2 showed that state anxiety also affected participants' movement behaviour, which was evidenced by an increased geometric index of entropy and by longer climbing times. Conclusions: Results indicated that anxiety indeed manifested itself at three levels. A possible explanation for the effects of anxiety that is also found in the literature is that a temporary regress may occur to a movement execution that is associated with earlier stages of motor learning.},

Masters' (1992) conscious processing hypothesis suggests that under pressure an inward focus of attention occurs, resulting in more conscious control of the movement execution of well-learned skills. The conscious processes interfere with automatic task execution hereby inducing performance decrements. Recent empirical support for the hypothesis has focused on the effects of pressure on end performance. It has not been tested so far whether the changes in performance are also accompanied by changes in movement execution that would be expected following Masters' hypothesis. In the current study we tested the effects of anxiety on climbing movements on a climbing wall. Two identical traverses at different heights on a climbing wall provided different anxiety conditions. In line with the conscious processing hypothesis we found that anxiety had a significant effect on participants' movement behaviour evidenced by increases in climbing time and the number of explorative movements (Experiments 1 and 2) and by longer grasping of the holds and slower movements (Experiment 2). These results provide additional support for the conscious processing hypothesis and insight into the relation between anxiety, performance, and movement behaviour.},

In Experiment 2, participants climbed from right to left and back again on the high and low traverses, which now entailed an abundance of holds. Consistent with the reduction of perceived and actual maximal reaching height found in Experiment 1, anxiety led to the use of more holds. Finally, in Experiment 3, points of light were sequentially projected around the participants while they were climbing to measure attention. As participants detected fewer lights in the high-anxiety condition, it was concluded that anxiety narrowed attention. In general, the results underscored that the actor's emotional state plays an important role in perceiving and realizing affordances and that the perception of affordances changes as the accompanying action capabilities change.},

Despite the generally accepted utility of functional fear, the nature of maladaptive fear remains controversial. There is still no consensus about how specific fears and phobias are acquired and modulated. Two major schools of thought are apparent: those suggesting dysfunctional fear arises largely as the result of associative-conditioning processes versus those who favour more biologically based etiological explanations. In this regard, the non-associative model of fear acquisition postulates the existence of a limited number of innate, evolutionary-relevant fears, while emphasising conditioning modes of onset for evolutionary-neutral fears. Recent retrospective and longitudinal studies have tested predictions from the non-associative model. In general, findings support non-associative hypotheses and are difficult to reconcile with neo-conditioning explanations of fear acquisition. These data suggest that four pathways to fear may provide the most parsimonious theory of fear etiology. The theoretical and practical implications of adding a fourth, non-associative path to Rachman's (Behav. Res. Ther. (1977) 15, 375\textendash 387) three `associative' pathways are discussed.

However, a handful of empirical studies on the relation between presence and anxiety in VRE have yielded mixed findings. The current study tested the following hypotheses about the relation between presence and anxiety in VRE with a clinical sample of fearful flyers: (1) presence is related to in-session anxiety; (2) presence mediates the extent that pre-existing (pre-treatment) anxiety is experienced during exposure with VR; (3) presence is positively related to the amount of phobic elements included within the virtual environment; (4) presence is related to treatment outcome. Results supported presence as a factor that contributes to the experience of anxiety in the virtual environment as well as a relation between presence and the phobic elements, but did not support a relation between presence and treatment outcome. The study suggests that presence may be a necessary but insufficient requirement for successful VRE.},

The purpose of the present article is to review the evidence that has emerged to support the potential of this therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
        Recent findings~Case histories and open comparative studies, as well as randomized controlled studies, have been published on the use of virtual reality exposure therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Most studies in the field have been on specific phobias, in particular on fear of flying, acrophobia, fear of driving, claustrophobia and fear of spiders. In addition, several studies have been published on the use of virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
        Summary~Recent studies provide evidence that virtual reality exposure therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of several anxiety disorders.

Using a self-report questionnaire, the sense of presence within this situation was measured. It was shown that fear increased with higher presence. The method, which involved 37 participants, was tested and validated with user tests at the Bauhaus University. A growing body of research in human-computer interface design for virtual environments (VE) concentrates on the problem of how to involve the user in the VE. This effect, usually called immersion or the sense of presence, has been the subject of much research activity. This research focuses on the influence of technical and technological parameters on the sense of presence. However, little work has been done on the effects of experienced sense of presence. One field in which a sense of presence is necessary for the successful application of VEs is the treatment of acrophobic patients. Our goals are to (a) create a theory-based self-report measurement for presence and (b) measure presence independently from specific effects to validate the measurement. The anxiety resulting from the confrontation with a virtual cliff is used to validate the measurement of presence.},

Partial eta squared is a similar measure in which the effects of other independent variables and interactions are partialled out. The development of these measures is described and their characteristics compared. In the past, the two measures have been confused in the research literature, partly because of a labelling error in the output produced by certain versions of the statistical package SPSS. Nowadays, partial eta squared is overwhelmingly cited as a measure of effect size in the educational research literature. Although there are good reasons for this, the interpretation of both measures needs to be undertaken with care. The paper concludes with a summary of the key characteristics of eta squared and partial eta squared.},

Nevertheless, it is less clear how to manipulate the content of interactive media to induce specific emotional responses. In particular, this is true for the emerging medium virtual reality (VR), whose main feature is the ability to induce a feeling of "presence" in the computer-generated world experienced by the user. The main goal of this study was to analyze the possible use of VR as an affective medium. Within this general goal, the study also analyzed the relationship between presence and emotions. The results confirmed the efficacy of VR as affective medium: the interaction with "anxious" and "relaxing" virtual environments produced anxiety and relaxation. The data also showed a circular interaction between presence and emotions: on one side, the feeling of presence was greater in the "emotional" environments; on the other side, the emotional state was influenced by the level of presence. The significance of these results for the assessment of affective interaction is discussed.},

In an attempt to go beyond the prevalent but simplistic "exhilaration' ' type of explanation for stress-seeking, this study examined the phenomenon in terms of the psychological characteristics associated with successful long-term involvement in the risk sport of rock climbing. Four behavioral characteristics were assessed: sensation seeking (SS), defined as "the need for varied, novel and complex sensations and experiences and the willingness to undertake physical and social risks for the sake of such experiences" (Zuckerman, 1979, p. 10); trait anxiety (TA), which refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness (Spielberger, Gorsuch, \& Lushene, 1970); need for achievement (NAch), which relates to the determinants of direction, magnitude, and persistence of behavior when the individual knows that his or her performance will be evaluated (Atkinson, 1964); and affiliation (AFF), which refers to the tendency to seek out, attain, and maintain a social bond with other people (Alderman, 1974).},

Initially developed by the psychologist Juri Hanin in the 1970s, the number of published studies using the model has since significantly grown and diversified. In an effort to create a comprehensive database of IZOF research and reviews, a literature search was conducted using several databases and existing reference lists. This analysis yielded a total of 183 IZOF-based publications (from 380 compiled). The list of publications was subdivided into several categories including general reviews (N = 25), assessment and methodology (N = 13), peer-reviewed and research papers involving samples ranging from elite athletes to physical education students (N = 120). Twenty-five studies were related to communication or interpersonal relationships, coaching and optimisation of performance. Future IZOF research directions will focus on multimodal profiling of athletes' performance-related emotional and non-emotional experiences, and assessment of individually optimal performance.},

Half the Ss had the feedback self-administered, and half had it administered by the experimenter. After puzzle-solving, Ss were left alone with additional puzzles and magazines and were observed to see if they worked on the puzzles. Finally, Ss completed a questionnaire assessing their interest and attitudes toward the target activity. Results confirm that controlling feedback, whether self- or other administered, undermined intrinsic motivation relative to task-involvement. Results are discussed in terms of the application of cognitive evaluation theory to intrapersonal processes and self-control theories.

  abstract = {Computers were once thought of as number-crunching machines; but for most of us it is their ability to create worlds and process words that have made them into a nearly indispensable part of life. As Jacques Leslie puts it, if computers are everywhere, it is because they have grown into "poetry machines." The term "cyberspace" captures the growing sense that beyond - or perhaps on - the computer screen lies a "New Frontier" both enticing and forbidding, a frontier awaiting exploration, promising discovery, threatening humanistic values, hatching new genres of discourse, and alerting our relation to the written word. The purpose of this book is to explore the concepts of text and the forms of textuality currently emerging from the creative chaos of electronic technologies. The essays gathered here address several needs in cybertext criticism: they engage in a critical, though not hostile, dialogue with the claims of the first generation developers and theorists; they search for a middle ground between a narrowly technical description of the works and general considerations about the medium; they outline a poetics tailor-made for electronic textuality, and they relate cybertexts to the major human, aesthetic and intellectual concerns of contemporary culture. Within the general territory of electronic textuality, they focus on three areas. The first section examines how postmodern thought has theorised the textual products of the recent electronic revolution, and how, conversely, these new forms of textuality challenge postmodern thought and call for an expansion of the analytical repertory of literary theory. The second section debates how, in an age that ties the sense of self to a sense of embodiment, identity is affected by the power of electronic technology to create virtual doubles of the body, and how it can it be constructed through electronic writing. The last section gathers three "performance texts" which complete a feed-back loop between electronic and print culture, as they turn the critical investigation of cyberspace textuality into a quest for new forms of literary theoretical writing.},

A between-group design was employed, where seven pairs of subjects used an interface with graphic representation of the environment, audio connection, and haptic force feedback. Seven other pairs of subjects used an interface without haptic force feedback, but with identical features otherwise. The PHANToM, a one-point haptic device, was used for the haptic force feedback, and a program especially developed for the purpose provided the virtual environment. The program enables for two individuals placed in  different locations to simultaneously feel and manipulate dynamic objects in a shared desktop virtual environment. Results show that haptic force feedback significantly improves task performance, perceived task performance, and pereceived virtual presence in the collaborative distributed environment. The results suggest that haptic force feedback increases perceived social presence, but the difference is not significant.},

We examined the efficacy of this perceptual-cognitive skill on indoor sport climbing performance. Twenty-nine male climbers, divided into intermediate, advanced and expert climbing level groups, climbed two indoor sport routes matching their climbing level and, where applicable, routes below their climbing level. At each level, one route was climbed with a preview, where participants benefited from a 3-min pre-ascent climbing route visual inspection. Performance was assessed in terms of output (route completion) and form (number and duration of moves and stops). Route preview did not influence the output performance. Climbers using visual inspection were no more likely to finish the ascent than those without the option of using visual inspection. Conversely, route preview did influence form performance; climbers made fewer, and shorter stops during their ascent following a preview of the route. Form performances differences remained when baseline ability levels were taken into account, although for shorter duration of stops only with expert climbers benefiting most from route preview. The ability to visually inspect a climb before its ascent may represent an essential component of performance optimization.},

  abstract = {Die in-virtuo-Exposition stellt ein vielversprechendes neues Verfahren zur Therapie von Angstst\"orungen dar. Bisherige Studien stellten das Presence-Erleben, welches das Gef\"uhl beschreibt, sich in der virtuellen Welt anwesend zu f\"uhlen (Slater \& Wilbur, 1997) und in ihr so zu handeln und zu empfinden, wie in der Realit\"at, in den Vordergrund und hoben die Rolle von Immersionstendenzen (Witmer \& Singer, 1998) und Aufmerksamkeitsprozesse (Schubert, Friedmann \& Regenbrecht, 2001; Waterworth \& Waterworth, 2001) als hiermit zusammenh\"angende Konstrukte heraus. Ziel der vorliegenden Analogstudie ist die Konstruktion eines Fragebogens zur Erhebung der Technologieakzeptanz virtueller Konfrontationsverfahren. Ferner sollen die Faktoren identifiziert werden, welche die Einsch\"atzung der N\"utzlichkeit der in-virtuo-Exposition als therapeutisches Verfahren beeinflussen. 
Die Daten von 116 Teilnehmern wurden in die statistische Analyse aufgenommen. Die Probanden beantworteten Frageb\"ogen zum Realit\"atserleben in der virtuellen Umgebung (iGroup Presence Questionnaire), zu der individuellen Immersionstendenz (Immersive Tendency Questionnaire) und zur Technologieakzeptanz (Technological Acceptance Model). Zur Erfassung der Aufmerksamkeitsleistung wurde das Frankfurter Aufmerksamkeitsinventar vorgegeben. 
Das TAM konnte f\"ur die Erhebung der Technologieakzeptanz von virtuellen Realit\"aten erweitert werden (TAM-VR) und misst die Einsch\"atzung der N\"utzlichkeit auf drei Skalen. Die erlebte Realit\"at ist ein Indikator f\"ur das Presence-Erleben und die Realit\"atstreue der VR  und der st\"arkste Pr\"adiktor f\"ur die Einsch\"atzung der N\"utzlichkeit. Die Skala Neugierde bildet die Eigenschaft der Person ab, neugierig auf die Verwendung eines computerbasierten Verfahrens wie der in-virtuo-Exposition zu sein, die Handhabbarkeit bewertet die Bedien- und Nutzerfreundlichkeit des Systems. Nicht repliziert werden konnte der direkte Einfluss von Aufmerksamkeitsprozessen auf das Presence-Erleben oder die Einsch\"atzung der N\"utzlichkeit. Es zeigte sich lediglich ein schwacher korrelativer Zusammenhang. Auch hatte die Immersionstendenz keinen Einfluss. Weitere Studien sind angezeigt, um die in-virtuo-Exposition empirisch abzusichern.},

  abstract = {The scientific study of emotion has long been dominated by theories emphasizing the subjective experience of emotions and their accompanying expressive and physiological responses. The processes by which different emotions are elicited has received less attention, the implicit assumption being that certain emotions arise automatically in response to certain types of events or situations. Such an assumption is incompatible with data showing that similar situations can provoke a range of emotions in different individuals, or even the same individual at different times. Appraisal theory, first suggested by Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus, was formulated to address this shortcoming in our understanding of emotion. The central tenet of appraisal theory is that emotions are elicited according to an individual's subjective interpretation or evaluation of important events or situations. Appraisal research focuses on identifying the evaluative dimensions or criteria that predict which emotion will be elicited in an individual, as well as linking the appraisal process with the production of emotional responses. This book represents the first full-scale summary of the current state of appraisal research. Separate sections cover the history of apraisal theory and its fundamental ideas, the views of some of the major theorists currently active in the field, theoretical and methodological problems with the appraisal approach including suggestions for their resolution, social, cultural and individual differences and the application of appraisal theory to understanding and treating emotional pathology, and the methodology used in appraisal research including measuring and analyzing self-report, physiological, facial, and vocal indicators of appraisal, and simulating appraisal processes via computational models. Intended for advanced students and researchers in emotion psychology, it provides an authoritative assessment and critique of the current state of the art in appraisal research.},

Recent empirical evidence in support of the model is reviewed. Special emphasis is given to the dynamic aspect of emotion processes, in particular the sequence of appraisal checks and the synchronisation of response systems, as well as the capacity of the model to predict individual differences in emotional responding.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world. However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still          missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and          theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows          that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli.          An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors          can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.},

In this paper, we present a study that investigates the influence of physical props on presence, stress and anxiety in a VR climbing environment involving whole body movement. To help climbers overcoming fear of falling, we compared three different conditions: Climbing in reality at 10 m height, physical climbing in VR (with props attached to the climbing wall) and virtual climbing in VR using game controllers. From subjective reports and biosignals, our results show that climbing with props in VR increases the anxiety and sense of realism in VR for sport climbing. This suggests that VR in combination with physical props are an effective simulation setup to induce the sense of height.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining increasing importance in science, education, and entertainment. A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of 'being' or 'acting', when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires' mean scores; however, we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that, besides reducing a study's duration and reducing disorientation, completing questionnaires in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.},

Special attention is paid to the phase response properties of the cardiac pacemaker.The model accounts for heart rate regulation, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and resonant interaction of respiration and blood pressure oscillations (Mayer waves).

Cardiac responses to neck suction were measured indirectly from electrocardiographic changes of heart period. Our results show that it is possible to separate the influences of respiratory and cardiac phases at the onset of a neck suction impulse by a product of two factors: one depending only on the respiratory phase and one depending only on the cardiac phase. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that efferent vagal activity is a function of afferent baroreceptor activity, whereas respiratory neurons modulate that medullary throughput independent of the cardiac phase. Furthermore, we have shown that stimulus broadening and stimulus cropping influence the outcome of neck suction experiments in a way that makes it virtually impossible to obtain information on the phase dependency of the cardiac pacemaker's sensitivity to vagal stimulation without accurate knowledge of the functional shape of stimulus broadening.},

Ten novices in rock climbing and five intermediate rock climbers were observed climbing an icefall. Locations of right and left ice tools and crampons were videotaped from a frontal camera. Inter-individual variability of upper and lower limb couplings and types of action regarding icefall properties were assessed by cluster hierarchical analysis, distinguishing three clusters. Pelvis vertical displacement, duration and number of pelvis pauses were also analyzed. Experienced rock climbers were grouped in the same cluster and showed the highest range and variability of limb angular locations and coordination patterns, the highest vertical displacement and the shortest pelvis plateaux durations. Non-fluent climbers (clusters 2 and 3) showed low range and variability of limb angular locations and coordination patterns. In particular, climbers of cluster 3 exhibited the lowest vertical displacement, the longest plateaux durations and the greatest ratio between tool swinging and definitive anchorage. Our results exemplified the positive influence of skills in rock climbing on ice climbing performance, facilitated by the detection of affordances from environmental properties.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the functional intra-individual movement variability of ice climbers differing in skill level to understand how icefall properties were used by participants as affordances to adapt inter-limb coordination patterns during performance. Seven expert climbers and seven beginners were observed as they climbed a 30 m icefall. Movement and positioning of the left and right hand ice tools, crampons and the climber's pelvis over the first 20 m of the climb were recorded and digitized using video footage from a camera (25 Hz) located perpendicular to the plane of the icefall. Inter-limb coordination, frequency and types of action and vertical axis pelvis displacement exhibited by each climber were analysed for the first five minutes of ascent. Participant perception of climbing affordances was assessed through: (i) calculating the ratio between exploratory movements and performed actions, and (ii), identifying, by self-confrontation interviews, the perceptual variables of environmental properties, which were significant to climbers for their actions. Data revealed that experts used a wider range of upper and lower limb coordination patterns, resulting in the emergence of different types of action and fewer exploratory movements, suggesting that effective holes in the icefall provided affordances to regulate performance. In contrast, beginners displayed lower levels of functional intra-individual variability of motor organization, due to repetitive swinging of ice tools and kicking of crampons to achieve and maintain a deep anchorage, suggesting lack of perceptual attunement and calibration to environmental properties to support climbing performance.},

In both cases presence can include feedback to the human senses of vision, hearing and haptics, both kinesthetic and cutaneous. Presence is discussed here in terms of alternative subjective meanings, operational measurements, and meaningful experimental comparisons. Three practical approaches to measurement of presence are discussed, including elicitation of ``natural'' neuromuscular or vocal responses, single or multidimensional subjective scaling, and ability to discriminate the real and immediate environment from that which is recorded transmitted or synthesized, under varying levels of constraint.

Few studies have tested acute physiological responses to climbing, and no studies to date have tested hormone responses to a climbing-based workout. This study aimed to measure testosterone (T), growth hormone (GH), and cortisol (C) responses to continuous vertical climbing in young male rock climbers. Ten male rock climbers, aged between 21 and 30 years, climbed laps on a submaximal 55{${'}$} climbing route for 30 min, or until exhaustion, whichever came first. Heart rate (HR) was recorded after every lap. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture before (Pre), immediately post (IP), and 15 min after the climbing exercise (P15) to assess blood lactate and plasma GH, T, and C. Subjects climbed 24.9 {$\pm$} 1.9 min and 507.5 {$\pm$} 82.5 feet. Peak HR was 182.1 {$\pm$} 2.3 bpm, and lactate (Pre: 2.9 {$\pm$} 0.6 mmol/dL, IP: 11.1 {$\pm$} 1.0 mmol/dL) significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) increased from Pre to IP. T concentrations significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) increased from Pre (6.04 {$\pm$} 0.31 ng/mL) to IP (7.39 {$\pm$} 0.40 ng/mL) and returned to baseline at P15 (6.23 {$\pm$} 0.33 ng/mL).

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

Despite that, there is not widespread agreement on how to define or operationalize this construct. The literature contains many different definitions of presence and many proposed measures for it. This article reviews many of the definitions, measures, and models of presence from the literature. We also review several related constructs, including social presence, copresence, immersion, agency, transportation, reality judgment, and embodiment. In addition, we present a meta-analysis of existing presence models and propose a model of presence informed by Slater's Place Illusion and Plausibility Illusion constructs.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses factors that may contribute to the participant's sense of presence in immersive virtual environments. We distinguish between external factors, that is those wholly determined by the hardware and software technology employed to generate the environment, and subjective factors, that is how sensory inputs to the human participant are processed internally. The therapeutic technique known as neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is used as a basis for measuring such internal factors. NLP uses the idea of representation systems (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) and perceptual position (egocentric or exocentric) to code subjective experience. The paper also considers one external factor, that is how the virtual environment represents a participant\textemdash either as a complete body, or just an arrow cursor that responds to hand movements. A case-control pilot experiment is described, where the controls have self-representation as an arrow cursor, and the experimental group subjects as a simple virtual body. Measurements of subjects' preferred representation systems and perceptual positions are obtained based on counts of types of predicates and references used in essays written after the experiment. These, together with the control variable (possession/absence of a virtual body), are used as explanatory variables in a regression analysis, with reported sense of presence as the dependent variable. Although tentative and exploratory in nature, the data analysis does suggest a relationship between reported sense of presence, preferred representation system, perceptual position, and an interaction effect between these and the virtual body factor.},

  abstract = {This article presents an interactive technique for moving through an immersive virtual environment (or ``virtual reality''). The technique is suitable for applications where locomotion is restricted to ground level. The technique is derived from the idea that presence in virtual environments may be enhanced the stronger the match between proprioceptive information from human body movements and sensory feedback from the computer-generated displays. The technique is an attempt to simulate body movements associated with walking. The participant ``walks in place'' to move through the virtual environment across distances greater than the physical limitations imposed by the electromagnetic tracking devices. A neural network is used to analyze the stream of coordinates  from the head-mounted display, to determine whether or not the participant is walking on the spot. Whenever it determines the walking behavior, the participant is moved through virtual space in the direction of his or her gaze. We discuss two experimental studies to assess the impact on presence of this method in comparison to the usual hand-pointing method of navigation in virtual reality. The studies suggest that subjective rating of presence is enhanced by the walking method provided that participants associate subjectively with the virtual body provided in the environment. An application of the technique to climbing steps and ladders is also presented.},

The task involved Tri-Dimensional Chess, and required subjects to reproduce on a real chess board the state of board learned from a sequence of moves witnessed in a virtual environment. Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic). The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment. Previous knowledge of chess, and amount of virtual practice were also significant, and may be considered as control variables to equalise these factors amongst the subjects. Other things being equal, males remembered the moves better than females, although female performance improved with higher spatial ability test score. The paper also attempts to clarify the relationship between immersion, presence and performance, and locates the experiment within such a theoretical framework.},

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE Conference in London, UK.},

In the experiment 20 participants were to walk through a virtual field of trees and count the trees with diseased leaves. A 2 \texttimes{} 2 between-subjects design was used to assess the influence of two factors on presence: tree height variation and task complexity. The field with greater variation in tree height required participants to bend down and look up more than in the lower variation tree height field. In the higher complexity task participants were told to remember the distribution of diseased trees in the field as well as to count them. The results showed a significant positive association between reported presence and the amount of body movement - in particular, head yaw - and the extent to which participants bent down and stood up. There was also a strong interaction effect between task complexity and gender: Women in the morecomplex task reported a much lower sense of presence than in the simpler task. For applications in which presence is an important requirement, the research in this paper suggests that presence will be increased when interaction techniques are employed that permit the user to engage in whole-body movement.},

At different times during an experience, a participant will occasionally switch between interpreting the totality of sensory inputs as forming the VE or the real world. The number of transitions from virtual to real is counted, and, using some simplifying assumptions, a probabilistic Markov chain model can be constructed to model these transitions. This model can be used to estimate the equilibrium probability of being \^apresent\^a in the VE. This technique was applied in the context of an experiment to assess the relationship between presence and body movement in an immersive VE. The movement was that required by subjects to reach out and touch successive pieces on a three-dimensional chess board. The experiment included twenty subjects, ten of whom had to reach out to touch the chess pieces (the active group) and ten of whom only had to click a handheld mouse button (the control group). The results revealed a significant positive association in the active group between body movement and presence. The results lend support to interaction paradigms that are based on maximizing the match between sensory data and proprioception.},

Seventeen of them saw the environment rendered with real-time recursive ray tracing (RT) that included shadows and reflections of their virtual body, and the remainder experienced the same environment rendered with ray casting (RC), which did not include shadows and reflections. Participants completed a presence questionnaire immediately after their experience, and physiological responses (skin conductance and electrocardiogram) were recorded throughout. Results show that subjective presence was higher for the RT environment than for the RC one and that higher stress was induced in the RT environment compared to the RC one.},

Quantified self means using technology to provide detailed quantitative measures of user performance, which can motivate one to set, and aim to achieve, specific goals. Gamification adds game elements and game-like reward systems that can help to increase motivation by providing regular positive feedback. While we are not the first to address physical exercising with gamification, this work investigates the combination of both approaches in a specific application area: electronic muscle stimulation training. The results of a first user study with 8 participants over 2 weeks indicate that there is a strong positive effect of combining both approaches in terms of intrinsic motivation and emotional valence and that this area is a worthy candidate for further study.},

They gave three estimates of the slant of the hill: a verbal report, a visually matched estimate, and a visually guided action. Fear of descending the hill was also assessed. Those participants that were scared (by standing on the skateboard) consciously judged the hill to be steeper relative to participants who were unafraid. However, the visually guided action measure was accurate across conditions.

Across all of the measures, a large, consistent bias was found: vertical distances were greatly overestimated, especially from the top. Secondary findings suggest that the overestimation of distance and size that occurs when looking down from a high place correlates with reports of trait- and state-level fear of heights, suggesting that height overestimation may be due, in part, to fear.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with different types of disease courses (relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive, primary progressive) that leads to physical as well as mental disability. The symptoms comprise paresis or/and paralysis, ataxia, bladder dysfunction, visual problems as well as effects on cognition. There is limited data regarding the possible effects of sport climbing respectively therapeutic climbing on patients with MS. Sport climbing offers many potentially beneficial effects for patients with MS since there are effects on coordination, muscular strength, and cognition to name the most relevant ones. Also, disease models in rodents point toward such positive outcomes of climbing. Therefore, we assessed the currently available research literature on general effects of physical exercise, impact of climbing on body and mind and therapeutic climbing for prevention or therapy for the treatment of MS. The sparse published controlled trials that investigated this sport activity on different groups of patients with neurological or geriatric diseases grossly differ in study design and outcome parameters. Nevertheless, it appears that climbing offers the opportunity to improve some of the symptoms of patients with MS and can contribute to an enhanced quality of life.},

While virtual simulation has been empirically validated to be effective in the transfer of skills to the live environment, what is still unknown is what effect, if any, that an individual's sense of presence in the simulation has on their performance. In this paper, we examine the relationship between presence and performance while performing a psychomotor task in a virtual environment. The independent variables were visual display and expertise level. The dependent variables were presence and performance. We found evidence of a moderate relationship between the degree of presence experienced in the simulation and an individual's performance over three training trials. Results of this study may inspire future research to investigate whether higher presence in virtual simulation results in higher performance.},

Four samples of athletes (high school athletes, female soccer players, and two samples of university student athletes) completed measures of perfectionism during competitions and competitive anxiety. Across samples, results show that overall perfectionism was associated with higher cognitive and somatic competitive anxiety. However, when striving for perfection and negative reactions to imperfection were differentiated, only the latter were associated with higher anxiety, whereas striving for perfection was unrelated to anxiety. Moreover, once the influence of negative reactions to imperfection was partialled out, striving for perfection was associated with lower anxiety and higher self-confidence. The present findings suggest that striving for perfection in sports is not maladaptive. On the contrary, athletes who strive for perfection and successfully control their negative reactions to imperfection may even experience less anxiety and more self-confidence during competitions.},

We sense an involvement with this physical world which gives us the ability to predict its properties well. For example, we can predict where objects will fall, how well-known shapes look from other angles, and how much force is required to push objects against friction. We lack corresponding familiarity with the forces on charged particles, forces in non-uniform fields, the effects of nonprojective geometric transformations, and high-inertia, low friction motion. A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland. Computer displays today cover a variety of capabilities. Some have only the fundamental ability to plot dots. Displays being sold now generally have built in line-drawing capability. An ability to draw simple curves would be useful. Some available displays are able to plot very short line segments in arbitrary directions, to form characters or more complex curves. Each of these abilities has a history and a known utility. It is equally possible for a computer to construct a picture made up of colored areas. Knowlton's movie language, BEFLIX [1], is an excellent example of how computers can produce area-filling pictures. No display available commercially today has the ability to present such area-filling pictures for direct human use. It is likely that new display equipment will have area-filling capability. We have much to learn about how to make good use of this new ability. The most common direct computer input today is the typewriter keyboard.

Also examined was the relationship between fear of falling and health-related Quality of Life (QOL). Health-related QOL concepts were measured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) within an elderly day services sample. Eligible subjects were elderly persons using Day Service (type B) who were capable of independently answering a questionnaire and had no memory problems. Forty-three males and 92 females were eligible for this study. Forty-nine (36.3\%) subjects expressed no fear of falling, whereas 22 (16.3\%) reported that they were very fearful of falling. Among females, walking and bathing had a highly significant relationship with the fear of falling. The fear of falling can contribute to psychological conditions such as depression, and also impacts on the health-related QOL of frail elderly people. Thus, it is critical to provide integrated health care activities for these individuals that address both psychological well-being and physical functioning.},

The current study provides evidence for an additional component in the domain of height fear - perception - and shows that it is distinct from measures of cognitive processing. Individuals High (N = 35) and Low (N = 36) in acrophobic symptoms looked over a two-story balcony ledge and estimated its vertical extent using a direct height estimation task (visual matching), and an indirect task (size estimation); the latter task seems to exhibit little influence from cognitive factors. In addition, implicit and explicit measures of cognitive processing were obtained. Results indicated that, as expected, the High Fear group showed greater relative, implicit height fear associations and explicit threat cognitions. Of primary interest, the High (compared to Low) Fear group estimated the vertical extent to be higher, and judged target sizes to be greater, even when controlling for the cognitive bias measures. These results suggest that emotional factors such as fear are related to perception.},

  abstract = {Scary climbing situations can appear when climbing on big walls. Some stones may be slippery due to humidity or smoothness and distances between belaying bolts can be large whereby a deep fall is risked. In such situations, the stress level increases, climbing performance decreases and an ascent might even be aborted. Furthermore, hazardous accidents can happen when the concentration is disturbed by stress and fear. Moreover, a beginner has to overcome some hurdles such as learning movements and belaying techniques as well as overcoming acrophobia or fear of falling down. We try to facilitate these hurdles with augmentation of the human in Mixed Reality (MR) superhuman sport climbing. In this paper, we present the development of a MR climbing system that tackles these hurdles by allowing a user to climb in safe height at ground level in reality while seeing his or her own body visualised in a much more demanding situation (e.g. in the middle of a big wall) in a Virtual Environment (VE) through a HMD. Additionally an audience can be integrated into the VE via a collaboration with an operator of a virtual drone. The drone operator has the ability to provide additional feedback, e.g. point to a certain stone with a virtual laser and can communicate with the climber via microphone. Hence, if a climber gets stuck in a climbing route, the drone operator can suggest the next move in the VE.},

However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

One group of ten subjects searched for a box in a real office environment. A second group of ten subjects carried out the same task in a virtual environment that simulated the same office. Immediately after their experience, subjects were given two different presence questionnaires in randomized order: the Witmer and Singer Presence (WS), and the questionnaire developed by Slater, Usoh, and Steed (SUS). The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a ``reality test'' whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores. It is concluded that, although such questionnaires may be useful when all subjects experience the same type of environment, their utility is doubtful for the comparison of experiences across environments, such as immersive virtual compared to real, or desktop compared to immersive virtual.},

  abstract = {Skin conductance (SC) is one of the most commonly used measures in psychophysiological studies involving emotional arousal and is traditionally measured at the fingers or the palms (i.e., the palmar locations) of the hand. Palmar skin conductance recording positions are, however, not always preferred for ambulatory recordings in real-life situations. This study quantifies the responsiveness and similarity with the finger of 16 different recording positions of skin conductance while watching emotional film fragments. Findings indicated foot, fingers and shoulders being most responsive, whereas arm, back, armpit, and thighbone were least responsive. The measurements at the foot were most similar with those of the finger. In contrast, arm, back, and armpit traces differed most from the finger trace. Taken together, foot and shoulders are the best alternatives to the finger for ambulatory measurement of skin conductance to reflect emotional arousal. These findings can help new applications using skin conductance, like automated emotion measurements, to come to fruition.},

In collaboration with industry experts with different creative backgrounds, we conducted a large-scale evaluation and examined the potential of NUIs in a professional work context. Our results indicate that NUIs can offer a usable alternative to standard 3D design software, requiring only a short familiarization phase instead of extensive training to achieve the intended outcome.},

It is conceived as a research tool for studying topics related to haptics in VR and based on off-the-shelf components. A robotic arm moves physical props, dynamically matching pose and location of an object in the virtual world. When the user reaches for the virtual object, his or her hands also encounter it in the real physical space. The interaction is not limited to specific body parts and does not rely on an external structure like an exoskeleton. In combination with a locomotion platform for close-to-natural walking, this allows unrestricted haptic interaction in a natural way in virtual environments of unlimited size. We describe the concept, the hardware and software architecture in detail. We establish safety design guidelines for human-robot interaction in VR. Our technical evaluation shows good response times and accuracy. We report on a user study conducted with 34 participants indicating promising results, and discuss the potential of our system.},

Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is preferred, difficulties arise with the exposure component (lack of therapist control, patient's inability to imagine, self-flooding, loss of confidentiality resulting from public exposure). Virtual reality CBT (VRCBT) enables a high degree of therapist control, thus overcoming these difficulties. This study examined whether VRCBT is an alternative to CBT. Participants with PSA were randomly assigned to VRCBT (28 participants), CBT (30 participants), and wait list control (WLC; 30 participants). VRCBT and CBT were significantly more effective than WLC in anxiety reduction on four of five anxiety measures, and on subject's self-rating of anxiety during a behavioral task. No significant differences were found on observer ratings of the behavioral task. However, twice as many participants dropped out from CBT than from VRCBT. Our results demonstrated that VRCBT is an effective and brief treatment regimen, equal to CBT.},

  abstract = {Specific phobia, situational type-driving, induced by accident (accident phobia) occurs in 18-38\% of those involved in a vehicular accident of sufficient severity to warrant referral to the emergency departments of a general hospital. The objective is to investigate, in an open study, the effectiveness of the combined use of computer generated environments involving driving games (game reality [GR]) and a virtual reality (VR) driving environment in exposure therapy for the treatment of driving phobia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) program. Fourteen subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for Simple Phobia/Accident Phobia and were referred from the emergency department of a general hospital were exposed to a Virtual Driving Environment (Hanyang University Driving Phobia Environment) and computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness/Rally Championship). Patients who experienced "immersion" (i.e., a sense of presence with heightened anxiety) in one of the driving simulations (defined as an increase in SUD ratings of 3 and/or an increase of heart rate {$>$} 15 BPM in a 1-h trial session of computer simulation driving) were exposed to a cognitive behavioral program of up to 12 1-h sessions involving graded driving simulation tasks with self-monitoring, physiological feedback, diaphragmatic breathing and cognitive reappraisal. Subjects were assessed at the beginning and end of therapy with measurements of: physiological responsivity (heart rate), subjective ratings of distress (SUD), rating scales for severity of fear of driving (FDI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CAPS) and depression (HAM-D) and achievement of target behaviors. Of all patients 7/14 (50\%) became immersed in the driving environments. This immersed group (n = 7) completed the exposure program. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons showed significant post treatment reductions on all measures SUDS (p = 0.008), FDI (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HR (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HAM-D (p = 0.031). Further analysis of the FDI showed significant reductions in all three subscales: travel distress (p = 0.008), travel avoidance (p = 0.008), and maladaptive driving strategies (p = 0.016). The findings of this study suggest that VR and GR may have a useful role in the treatment of driving phobia post-accident even when co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are present.},

The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.},

In this paper, the effect of scaling below the threshold of perception on presence during a target acquisition task was studied. It was assumed, that presence is reduced when head motion is scaled. No effect on presence, simulator sickness and performance was found. A significant effect on physical task load was found. The results yield information for further work and for the required verification of the used concept of presence. It can be assumed, that load can be modified by the scaling without significantly influencing the quality of presence.},

Spatial information, such as the position of holds, as well as learning complex body postures plays a major role in this process. A typical problem that occurs during advising is an alignment effect when trying to picture orientation-specific knowledge, e.g. explaining how to perform a certain self-climbed move to others. We propose betaCube, a self-calibrating camera-projection unit that features 3D tracking and distortion-free projection. The system enables a life-sized video replay and climbing route creation using augmented reality. We contribute an interface for automatic setup of mobile distortion-free projection, blob detection for climbing holds, as well as an automatic method for extracting planar trackables from artificial climbing walls.},

On the other hand, ambulatory assessment is less constrained and provides naturalistic data on emotion in daily life, with the potential to (1) assure external validity of laboratory findings, (2) provide normative data on prevalence, quality and intensity of real-life emotion and associated processes, (3) characterize previously unidentified emotional phenomena, and (4) model real-life stimuli for representative laboratory research design. Technological innovations now allow for detailed ambulatory study of emotion across domains of subjective experience, overt behavior and physiology. However, methodological challenges abound that may compromise attempts to characterize biobehavioral aspects of emotion in the real world. For example, emotional effects can be masked by social engagement, mental and physical workloads, as well as by food intake and circadian and quasi-random variation in metabolic activity. The complexity of data streams and multitude of factors that influence them require a high degree of context specification for meaningful data interpretation. We consider possible solutions to typical and often overlooked issues related to ambulatory emotion research, including aspects of study design decisions, recording devices and channels, electronic diary implementation, and data analysis.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to test the conflicting predictions of processing efficiency theory (PET) and the conscious processing hypothesis (CPH) regarding effort's role in influencing the effects of anxiety on a golf putting task. Mid-handicap golfers made a series of putts to target holes under two counterbalanced conditions designed to manipulate the level of anxiety experienced. The effort exerted on each putting task was assessed though self-report, psychophysiological (heart rate variability) and behavioural (pre-putt time and glances at the target) measures. Performance was assessed by putting error. Results were generally more supportive of the predictions of PET rather than the CPH as performance was maintained for some performers despite increased state anxiety and a reduction in processing efficiency. The findings of this study support previous research suggesting that both theories offer useful theoretical frameworks for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in sport.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions:  the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

Fifteen elite athletes from the UK were interviewed with regard to potential sources of organizational stress in preparation for major international competitions. Four main organizational stress issues were examined: environmental issues, personal issues, leadership issues, and team issues. The main environmental issues that were revealed were: selection, the training environment, and finances. The main personal issues were: nutrition, injury, and goals and expectations. The main leadership issues revealed were: coaches, and coaching styles. The main team issues were: team atmosphere, support network, roles, and communication. The results are presented largely in the form of direct quotes to convey the intricate nature of the issues. The results are discussed in terms of the important practical and theoretical implications of organizational stress in elite sport, particularly for those researchers and practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of elite performers as they prepare for major international competitions. Also, some possible strategies for coping with organizational stress in elite sport are discussed.},

  abstract = {Interest in virtual reality (VR) as a clinical tool to augment posttraumatic stress (PTSD) treatment has grown substantially in recent years due to advances in VR technology. Moreover, its potential assisted use in the PTSD diagnostic process has been recognized. In this study we examined physiological responding, skin conductance, to a standardized presentation of non-personalized combat-related VR events (e.g. encountering enemy fire; explosions) as compared to non-combat classroom VR events in 19 Veterans with and 24 Veterans without combat-related PTSD who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Veterans watched a total of 12 VR scenarios\textemdash six combat-related and six non-combat-related\textemdash with each scenario gradually increasing in emotional intensity by adding more VR events in addition to repeating prior VR events. Results show that Veterans with PTSD displayed larger skin conductance reactivity across VR combat events, but not for non-combat VR events, as compared to combat Veterans without PTSD. Nevertheless, Veterans with and without PTSD showed a similar reduction of emotional arousal to repeated presentation of the same VR combat events. Within the PTSD sample, the elevated level of VR combat-related arousal correlated marginally with severity of hyperarousal symptoms. This study confirms that the use of a non-personalized and standardized VR presentation successfully distinguishes Veterans with PTSD from those without on a measure of psychophysiological arousal to combat-related VR stimuli. The assessment of physiological reactivity during the repeated presentation of standardized, trauma-related VR events highlights its use for PTSD assessment as well as treatment.},

So far few works have studied this problem. In this study, a general framework, termed TROIKA, is proposed, which consists of signal decomposiTion for denoising, sparse signal RecOnstructIon for high-resolution spectrum estimation, and spectral peaK trAcking with verification. The TROIKA framework has high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many variants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/h showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.34 beat per minute, and the Pearson correlation between the estimates and the ground truth of heart rate was 0.992. This framework is of great values to wearable devices such as smartwatches which use PPG signals to monitor heart rate for fitness.},

Spectral and baroreflex analyses were performed in the EUROBAVAR data set (46 recordings of 23 persons) using the original ECG sampling frequency of 500 Hz and \textendash{} simulated \textendash{} sampling frequencies of 200 and 100 Hz. For this analysis, the technique of trigonometric regressive spectral (TRS) analysis was used. In the standing position, there were no statistically significant differences in baroreflex sensitivity and frequency bands ranging from VLF to HF using 100 Hz instead of the original 500 Hz. Only the UHF band ({$>$}0.40 Hz) was significantly different. In the supine position, similar results could be described for 100 Hz, although there were slight, but significant (P {$<$} 0.05) changes in baroreflex sensitivity of around 1 ms/mmHg at the simulated 100 Hz. Using a simulated 200 Hz instead of a 500 Hz sampling frequency had no significant impact on the spectral and baroreflex parameters. The probability to demonstrate an impact of different ECG sampling frequencies was higher in people with pathologically decreased variability of RR intervals. In most of the cases, it is sufficient for spectral and baroreflex analysis by TRS to use data with an ECG sampling frequency of 100 Hz in comparison to 500 Hz. Only if there is a pathologically decreased variability of RR intervals in patients, spectral and baroreflex parameters could be significantly influenced by lower ECG sampling frequencies of up to 100 Hz, but only to a minor degree.},

  abstract = {Journal of Medical Internet Research - International Scientific Journal for Medical Research, Information and Communication on the Internet, \#Preprint \#PeerReviewMe: Warning: This is a unreviewed preprint. Readers are warned that the document has not been peer-reviewed by expert/patient reviewers or an academic editor, may contain misleading claims, and is likely to undergo changes before final publication, if accepted, or may have been rejected/withdrawn. Readers with interest and expertise are encouraged to sign up as peer-reviewer, if the paper is within an open peer-review period. Please cite this preprint only for review purposes or for grant applications and CVs (if you are the author). Background: The success of Internet-based mental health interventions in practice - i.e., in-the-wild - depends on the uptake and retention of the application and the user's focused attention in the moment of use. Incorporating game-based motivational design into digital interventions delivered in-the-wild has been shown to increase uptake and retention in Internet-based training; however, there are outstanding questions about the potential of game-based motivational strategies to increase engagement with a task in the moment of use, and - as a result - improve intervention efficacy without accompanying increases in treatment exposure. Objective: Designers of Internet-based interventions need to know whether game-based motivational design strategies can increase in-the-moment engagement and thus improve intervention efficacy. We investigate the effects of one motivational design strategy (avatar customization) in an example mental health intervention (computerized cognitive training for attention bias modification). Methods: We assigned 317 participants to either a customized avatar or an assigned avatar condition. After measuring state-anxiety (STAI), we randomly assigned half of the participants in each condition to either an attentional retraining condition (ABMT) or a control condition. After training, participants were exposed to a Negative Mood Induction using images with strong negative valance (IAPS), after which we measured state-anxiety again Results: Avatar customization improved treatment efficacy, evidenced as decreased post-training state-anxiety when controlling for baseline state-anxiety, for those who trained attention bias modification; however, those who did not train experienced decreased resilience to the negative mood induction (F1,252=6.86, P=.009, {$\eta$}p2=.027). Together these results suggest that customization increased task engagement with the intervention in the moment of use. Avatar customization also increased avatar identification (F5,252=12.46, P{$<$}.001, R2=.23), regardless of whether or not participants trained attentional bias (F1,252=.79, P=.378). Avatar identification reduced anxiety after the negative mood induction for participants who underwent training, but increased post-stimulus anxiety for participants who did not undergo training, further suggesting that customization increases engagement in the task (F1,252=6.19, P=.014). The beneficial effect of avatar customization on training was driven by participants who were low in their basic satisfaction of relatedness (F10,248=18.5, P{$<$}.001, R2=.43), which is important because these are the participants who are most likely in need of digital interventions for mental health. Conclusions: Our results suggest that applying motivational design can improve the efficacy of attentional retraining, without increasing treatment exposure. Avatar customization is a viable strategy to increase engagement and subsequent training efficacy in a computerized cognitive task.},

Its expression in risky behaviors such as extreme and risky sports, vocations, substance abuse, unsafe sex, and crime, among others, is the topic of this fascinating and accessible book. In Sensation Seeking and Risky Behavior, Marvin Zuckerman offers a comprehensive view of the role of sensation seeking in a wide range of behaviors, from risky driving and sports through substance use, sex, and crime or other antisocial behaviors. How the personality trait sensation seeking relates to these risky behaviors is described and explained in terms of genetics, biology, attitudes, and expectancies. Insights into prevention and treatment of maladaptive forms of sensation seeking, like substance abuse and unsafe sexual activity, based on the published research, are offered.},
