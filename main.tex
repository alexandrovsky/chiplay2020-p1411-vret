%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Overcoming a range of challenges that traditional therapy faces, \ac{VRET} yields great potential for the treatment of phobias such as acrophobia, the fear of heights.
We investigate this potential and present \ac{PUT}, a novel game-based approach for \ac{VRET}. Based on a requirement analysis consisting of a literature review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and implemented the \ac{PUT} concept as a two-step VR game design.
To validate our approach, we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with $31$ non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception, and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both studies reveal that the \ac{PUT} approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design and exposure therapy.
